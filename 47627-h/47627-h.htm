<h2 class="space-above">PREFACE</h2>


<p>The native Kentuckian has a deep and abiding affection
for the "Old Commonwealth" which gave him birth.
It is as passionate a sentiment, too&mdash;and some might
add, as irrational&mdash;as the love of a Frenchman for his native
France. But it is an innocent idolatry in both, and both
are entitled to the indulgent consideration of alien critics
whose racial instincts are less susceptible and whose emotional
nature is under better control. Here and there, a
captious martinet who has been wrestling, mayhap, with a
refractory recruit from Kentucky, will tell you that the average
Kentuckian is scarcely more "educable" than his own
horse; that he is stubborn, irascible, and balky; far from
"bridle-wise," and visibly impatient under disciplinary restraint.
In their best military form Kentuckians have been
said to lack "conduct" and "steadiness"&mdash;even the men
that touched shoulders in the charge at King's Mountain
and those, too, that broke the solid Saxon line at the Battle
of the Thames.</p>

<p>Whether this be true or not&mdash;in whole or in part&mdash;we
do not now stop to enquire. Suffice it to say that the Kentuckian
has been a participant in many wars, and has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
a good account of himself in all. In ordinary circumstances,
too, he is invincibly loyal to his native State; and when it
happened that, in the spring of 1906, there came to Kentuckians
in exile, an order or command from the hospitable
Governor of Kentucky to return at once to the State, they
responded with the alacrity of distant retainers to a signal
from the hereditary Chieftain of the Clan. "Now," said
they, "the lid will be put on and the latch-string left out."</p>

<p>When the reflux current set in it was simply prodigious&mdash;quite
as formidable to the unaccustomed eye as the fieldward
rushing of a host; and it was in the immediate presence
of that portentous ethnic phenomenon that the paper upon
the "Lost Race" was first published;&mdash;appearing in a
local journal of ability and repute, and serving in some
measure as a contribution to the entertainment of the guests
that were now crowding every avenue of approach.</p>

<p>It is not strange that the generous Kentuckians, then
only upon hospitable thoughts intent, should imagine for
one happy <i lang="fr">quart d'heure</i> that the "Lost Race" of the morning
paper was already knocking at their doors. But they
little imagined&mdash;these good Kentuckians&mdash;that their hospitable
suspicion had really a basis of historic truth.</p>

<p>The handsome book now launched from the Louisville
press is merely that ephemeral contribution to a morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
paper,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> presented in a revised and expanded form, with such
illustrations as could come only from the liberal disposition
and cultivated taste of Colonel R. T. Durrett, the President of
The Filson Club. The title which the writer has given the
book is recommended, in part, by the example of a great
writer of romance, who held that the <em>name</em> of the book should
give no indication of the <em>nature of the tale</em>. If the indulgent
reader should be unconvinced by the "argument" that is
implied in almost every paragraph, it is hoped that he will
at least derive some entertainment from the copious flow of
reminiscential and discursive talk. The book is addressed
chiefly to those persons who may have the patience to read
it and the intelligence to perceive that nothing it contains is
written with a too serious intent.</p>

<p>The writer makes grateful acknowledgments to the many
friends who have encouraged him with approval and advice
in the preparation of the work. For the correction of his
errors and the continuance of his labors he looks with confident
expectation to the <span class="smcap">Scholars of the State</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>While the Home-Coming Kentuckians were
enjoying their meeting, in Louisville, in the
month of June, 1906, Doctor Thomas E. Pickett
published a newspaper article which he had written for
the Home-Coming Week, the object of which was to
present the theory of Paul B. Du Chaillu as to the descent
of the English-speaking people from the Scandinavians
instead of the Teutons; and to show that the descendants
of these Scandinavians were still existing in different
countries, and especially in Kentucky. The author sent
me a copy of his article, and after reading it I deemed
it an ethnological paper worthy of a more certain and
enduring preservation than a daily newspaper could
promise, and concluded that it would be suitable for one
of the publications of The Filson Club. I wrote to the
author about it, and suggested that if he could enlarge
it enough to make one of the annual publications of the
Club, of the usual number of pages, and have it ready
in time, it might be issued for the Club publication of
1907. The author did as I suggested, and the book to
which this is intended as an introduction is number twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>two
of The Filson Club publications, entitled "The Quest
for a Lost Race," by Thomas E. Pickett, M. D., LL. D.,
member of The Filson Club.</p>

<p>Many persons of the English-speaking race of to-day
believe that the English originated in England. The
race doubtless was formed there, but it came of different
peoples, principally foreign, who only consolidated upon
English soil. Half a dozen or more alien races combined
with one native to make the English as we now know
them, and many years of contention and change were
required to weld the discordant elements into a homogeneous
whole.</p>

<p>The original inhabitants of England, found there by
Julius Cæsar fifty-five years before the Christian era and
then first made known to history, were Celts, who were
a part of the great Aryan branch of the Caucasian race.
Their numbers have been estimated at 760,000, and they
were divided into thirty-eight different tribes with a
chief or sovereign for each tribe. They were neither
barbarians nor savages in the strict sense of these terms.
They were civilized enough to make clothes of the skins
of the wild animals they killed for food; to work in metals,
to make money of copper and weapons of iron, to have
a form of government, to build cabins in which to live,
to cultivate the soil for food, and to construct war chariots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
with long scythes at the sides to mow down the enemy
as trained horses whirled the chariots through their ranks.
They had military organizations, with large armies commanded
by such generals as Cassivelaunus, Cunobelin,
Galgacus, Vortigern, and Caractacus, and once one of
their queens named Boadicea led 230,000 soldiers against
the Romans. The bravery with which Caractacus commanded
his troops, and the eloquence with which he
defended himself and his country before the Emperor
Claudius when taken before him in irons to grace a Roman
triumph, compelled that prejudiced sovereign to order
the prisoner's chains thrown off and him and his family
to be set at liberty. There were enough brave men and
true like Caractacus among these Celts, whose country
was being invaded and desolated, to have secured to the
race a better fate than befell them. After being
slaughtered and driven into exile into Brittany and the
mountains of Wales by Roman, Saxon, and Dane for
eight hundred years, the few of them that were left alive
were not well enough remembered even to have their
name attached to their own country.</p>

<p>The Celt was entirely ignored and a name combined
of those of two of the conquerors given to their country.
Who will now say that Anglo-Saxon is a more appropriate
name for historic England than the original Albion, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Britannia, or Norman-French, or Celt? Anglo-Saxon,
compounded of Anglen and Saxon, the names of two
tribes of Low Dutch Teutons, can but suggest the piracy,
the robbery, the murder and the treachery with which
these tribes dealt with the Celts; while Norman-French
reminds us of the courage, the endurance, and the refinement
which were infused into the English by the Norman
Conquest. Celt is a name which ought to have been
respected for its antiquity of many centuries since it
left its ancient Bactria and found its way to England
without a known stain upon its national escutcheon.
These Celts were once a mighty people occupying France,
Spain, and other countries besides England, but their
descendants are now scattered among other nations,
without a country or a name of their own.</p>

<p>There may be doubts whether the Angles, the Jutes,
the Saxons, and the Danes&mdash;all of whom shared in partial
conquests of England and in the establishment of the
English race&mdash;were Scandinavians or Teutons, Normans or
Germans. They all belonged to the great Aryan branch
of the Caucasian race, and whatever differences or similarities
originally existed between them must have changed
in the thousands of years since they emigrated from their
first home. There can be no doubt, however, about the
nationality of William the Conqueror. He was Scandi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>navian
by descent from a long line of noble Scandinavian
ancestors. The home of his ancestors was in Norway,
far to the north of the home of the Teutons in Germany.
In this bleak land of Arctic cold and sterility, on the
western coast of Norway, where innumerable islands
form a kind of sea-wall along the shore, his ancestor,
Rognvald, who was a great earl holding close relations
with King Harold of Norway, had his home and his landlocked
harbor, in which ships were built for the vikings
who sailed from that port to the shores of all countries
which they could conquer or plunder. Here, his son
Gongu Hrolf, better known as Rollo or Rolf, was born
and received his training as a viking. On his return
from one of his viking raids to the East he committed
some depredations at home, for which King Harold banished
him. He then fitted out a ship and manned it with
a crew of his own choice and sailed for the British Channel
islands. When he reached the river Seine he went up
it as far as Paris, and, according to the fashion of the
times, laid waste the country as he went. King Charles
of France offered to buy him off by conveying to him
the country since known as Normandy and giving him
his daughter in marriage, on condition that he would
become a Christian and commit no more depredations
in the King's domain. Rollo accepted the King's offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
and at once ceased to be a viking, and began to build up,
enlarge and strengthen the domain which had been given
him with the title of Duke. In the course of time his
dukedom of Normandy, with the start Rollo had given
it and its continuance under his successors, became one
of the most powerful and enlightened countries of the
period.</p>

<p>At the death of Rollo his dukedom was inherited by
his son, William, and after passing through four generations
of his descendants who were dukes of Normandy
it descended to a second William, known as the Conqueror.
Duke William, therefore, could trace his Scandinavian
descent through his paternal ancestors back to Rognvald,
the great earl of Norway, and even further back through
the earls Eystein Glumra, Ivar Uppland, and possibly
other noblemen of hard names to write or pronounce or
remember. It is possible that some of his ancestors
were with Lief the Scandinavian when he made his discovery
of America, nearly five hundred years before the
discovery of Columbus.</p>

<p>In 1066, Duke William took advantage of a promise,
solemnized by an oath, which Harold had made before
he was King of England, to assist him to the throne of
England, but which he had not kept. Hence William
invaded England with a great army, and at the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
of Hastings slew King Harold and gained a complete
victory over his forces. Duke William was soon after
crowned King of England, and at once began that wise
policy which in a few years enabled him to lay firmly
the foundation of the great English nation. His conquest,
though not complete at first, was more so than had been
that of the Romans, or the Angles and Jutes, or the
Saxons or the Danes. At the time of the Conquest of
William there were hostile Celts, Romans, Angles, Jutes,
and Danes in every part of his kingdom. It was not
his policy to destroy any more of them than he deemed
necessary, but to make as many of them citizens loyal
to him as possible; hence his numerous army and the
still more numerous hosts that were constantly coming
from Normandy to England in time became reconciled
to the people and the people to them, until all were consolidated
into one homogeneous nation. English history
may be said to have begun with the Conquest of William,
for all previous history in the island was but little more
than the record of kings and nobles and pretenders contending
against kings, nobles, and pretenders, and sections
and factions and individuals seeking their own
aggrandizement. The Conquest of William began with
the idea of all England under one sovereign, and he and
his successors clung to this view until it was accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
England never went backward from William's Conquest
as it did from others, but kept right on in the course of
empire until it became one of the greatest countries in
the world, and this conquest was made by Scandinavians,
who, if they did not make Scandinavians of the conquered,
so Scandinavianized them that it would be difficult to
distinguish them from Scandinavians.</p>

<p>The evolution of the English race from so many discordant
national elements reminds one of the act of the
witches of Macbeth, casting into the boiling cauldron so
many strange things to draw from the dark future a fact
so important as the fate of a king. Who would have
thought that from the mingling of the Celts and the
Romans and the Angles and the Jutes and the Saxons and
the Danes and the Normans and the French in the great
national cauldron that such a race as the English would
be evolved? But it is not certain that such a race would
have been produced if William the Scandinavian and his
French had been left out. He came at a time when a
revolution was needed in manners and language as well
as in politics, and imparted that refinement which the
French had gotten from the Romans and other nations.
The French language so imparted soon began to infuse
its softening influence into the jargon of the conglomeration
of tongues in vogue, and the French manners to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
refine the clownish habits which had come down from
original Celt, Saxon, and Dane. The Saxons and Danes
had inhabited England for the four hundred years which
followed the same period occupied by the Romans,
without materially changing the manners or the language
of the English, but it was not as long as either of these
periods after the Conquest before the Englishman acted
and spoke like a gentleman and belonged to a country
which commanded the respect as well as fear of all other
nations. The Scandinavian's fondness for war soon
infused itself into the English and made them invincible
upon both land and sea, and now with a land which so
envelopes the earth that they boast the sun always shines
on some part of it, they may look back some hundreds
of years to the origin of their greatness and find no one
thing which contributed more to the glory of England
than the Norman-French Conquest.</p>

<p>But the reader had better learn the views of Paul B.
Du Chaillu, an accomplished ethnologist and explorer,
about the descent of the English from the Scandinavians
instead of the Teutons as set forth in Doctor Pickett's
book than from me in an introduction to it. Doctor
Pickett explains the Du Chaillu theory, and gives
examples of similar tastes and habits between English
and Scandinavians which are striking. He also gives a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
long list of names borne by Scandinavians in England
and Normandy eight hundred years ago which are the
same as names borne by Kentuckians to-day. In this
introduction, I have rather confined myself to such
historic matters as are involved, without alluding to the
ethnological facts so well presented in the text by the
author. The work is beautifully and copiously illustrated
with halftone likenesses of the author and Du Chaillu
and by a number of distinguished Kentuckians of Scandinavian
descent. There was both good taste and skill in
placing among the illustrations the likenesses of Theodore
O'Hara, John T. Pickett, Thomas T. Hawkins, and
William L. Crittenden, who joined the filibustering expeditions
of Lopez to Cuba. These distinguished citizens,
like the Scandinavian vikings whom they imitated, lost
nothing of their character by raiding upon a neighbor's
lands, and are among the best examples of the theory
of the descent of the English-speaking people from
Scandinavians rather than Teutons. To be an admirer
of this work it is not necessary to be a believer in the
theory of Du Chaillu, that the English are descended
from Scandinavians instead of Teutons. The truth is,
all the northern nations connected with England were
kinsmen descended from the same stock&mdash;Celts, Romans,
Angles, Jutes, Saxons, and Danes all being of the Aryan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
branch of the great Caucasian race. They are so much
alike in some particulars that fixed opinions about
differences or likenesses between them are more or less
untenable. There is one thing, however, in the book
about which there can be no two opinions, and that is
the value and importance of the list of names copied
from records eight hundred years old, in England and
Normandy. As many of them are the same as names
now borne by living families in Kentucky, they can
hardly fail to be of help to those in search of family
genealogy. Doctor Pickett has presented in this work
the theory of Du Chaillu in charming words and with
excellent taste, as the theory of Du Chaillu and not as
his own, and such has been my effort with regard to myself
in this introduction. It is simply the resumption of
a "Quest."</p>

<p class="center"><big>THE QUEST FOR A LOST RACE</big><br />

<small>BY</small><br />

THOMAS E. PICKETT, M. D.</p>

<hr class="small" />


<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a></h2>


<p>Upon the northern border of Mr. James Lane Allen's
"Arcady" there rises with picturesque distinctness
against a range of green hills the pleasant old Kentucky
town of Maysville, which, unlike the typical town of the
South, is neither "sleepy" nor "quaint," but in a notable
degree animated, bustling, ambitious, advancing, and up-to-date.
It must be confessed, however, that here and
there, in certain secluded localities, it is architecturally
antique. Constructed almost wholly of brick, and planted
solidly upon the lower slopes of the wooded hills, the
site is indescribably charming, and, looked at from a
distant elevation in front or from the elevated plateau
of the environing hills, presents a pleasing completeness
and finish in the <i lang="fr">coup d'&oelig;il</i>. At one glance the eye
takes in the compact little city, set gem-like in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
crescentic sweep of the river that flows placidly past the
willow-fringed shore and the walled and graded front.
The scene is likewise suggestive, since it marks the
northern limit of the "phosphatic limestone" formation
which assures the permanent productiveness of the overlying
soil&mdash;a natural fertilizer which by gradual disintegration
perpetually renews the soil exhausted by prolonged
or injudicious cultivation.</p>

<p>The town is of Virginian origin. At one time, indeed,
it was a Virginian town. The rich country to the south
of it was peopled chiefly by tobacco planters from
"Piedmont" Virginia, slaveholding Virginians of a
superior class.</p>

<p>In the infancy of this early Virginian settlement it
was vigilantly guarded by the famous Occidental hunters,
Kenton and Boone; the former a commissioner of roads
for the primitive Virginian county, then ill-cultivated and
forest clad: the latter, a leading "trustee" of the embryonic
Eighteenth Century town. As we pass through
the streets near the center of the place to-day we note
the handsome proportions of a public edifice which has
come down to us from the early mid-century days&mdash;an
imposing "colonial" structure with a lofty, well-proportioned
cupola and a nobly columned front. It is that
significant symbol of Southern civilization&mdash;the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>house.
To the artistic and antiquarian eye the building
is the glory of the old "Virginian" town, since it appeals
at once to civic pride and superior critical taste.</p>

<p>It was here&mdash;in the capacious auditorium of the Courthouse,
and in the closing quarter of the last century&mdash;that
a large and enthusiastic gathering of really typical
Kentuckians, familiar from childhood with tales of wild
adventure, greeted with rapturous applause the renowned
hunter and explorer, Paul Du Chaillu, a native of Paris,
France. A common taste for woodcraft had brought the
alien elements in touch. The Frenchman was a swell
hunter of big game, and had come hither to repeat his
graphic recital of experiences in the equatorial haunts
of that formidable anthropoid&mdash;the Gorilla. Du Chaillu's
discovery of the gorilla and the Obonga dwarfs was so
astounding to modern civilization that strenuous
efforts were made to discredit it, notably by Gray and
Barth. But later explorations amply vindicated the
Frenchman's claims.</p>

<p>He had a like experience later. The adventurous
explorer had come to Kentucky in prompt response to an
invitation from a local club, a social and literary organization
which owed its popularity and success chiefly to
the circumstance that the genial members, though sometimes
intemperately "social," were never obtrusively "liter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>ary."
The social feature was particularly pleasing to
the accomplished Frenchman, who was a man of the
world in every sense, and who dropped easily into congenial
relations with gentlemen who had an hereditary
and highly cultivated taste for <i lang="fr">le sport</i> in all its phases.
Take them when or where you might, the spirit of <i lang="fr">camaraderie</i>
was in them strong. They told a good story in
racy English and with excellent taste. They had studied
with discrimination the composition of a Bourbon "cocktail."
They had a distinctly connoisseurish appreciation
of the flavor, fragrance, and tints of an Havana cigar.
They had a traditional preference for Bourbon in their
domestic and social drinking, but they always kept ample
supplies of imported wines for their guests.</p>

<p>The genial Frenchman was very indulgent to the
generous tipple of his hosts. He drank their Bourbon
without apparent distaste; he praised their imported
Mumm and Clicquot. He did better still; he drank
the imported champagne with appreciation&mdash;a high compliment
from such a source.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/f_004.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">PAUL B. DuCHAILLU.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Clearly enough the harmony between the guest and his
environment was complete. These courteous and loquacious
Kentuckians were not only brilliant and audacious
<i lang="fr">raconteurs</i>, but with their varied experiences as sportsmen
had a variety of marvelous stories to tell. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
their stock of pioneer exploits fell short, they would listen
with polite interest to their guest's weird stories of the
African jungle, and cleverly cap them with reminiscences
of a miraculous outing on Reelfoot Lake or Kinniconick.
They were themselves experts with the rifle and the long
bow, and were loaded to the muzzle with authentic traditions
of the rod and gun.</p>

<p>The jungle stories were all right, but the African hunter
was never allowed to forget that he was in the land of
the hunter Boone. The very ground upon which they
commemoratively wassailed had been consecrated by the
footsteps of the great explorer of the West. The beastly
"anthropoids" that confronted <em>him</em> were armed with
tomahawks and guns. A salient point of difference indeed.
The clever and daring Frenchman listened with smiling
interest to their characteristic spurts of "brag," and was
silently remarking, no doubt, its curious affinity to the
gasconade of France. He seemed to feel perfectly at
home. And who of us that were present can ever forget
the impression of that dark, resolute face, the illumining
smile, the gleaming teeth, and the kindly, humorous glance
of the piercing eye? His experiences at the clubroom
only partially prepared him for the peculiar impressiveness
of the audience that greeted him at the stately old
Courthouse. There were the same men, to be sure, hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>some,
graceful, courteous, smiling, and soft of speech;
but the women!&mdash;with their lovely faces, their handsome
dresses, their enchanting manners, their distinction, ease
and charm! The Frenchman was never more of a philosopher
than when he gazed upon this scene.</p>

<p>He told his tale of the jungle simply, but with a vividness
that was realistic and startling to a degree. The
fascination of the audience was complete. He not only
described that strange encounter in the African forest,
but he re-enacted the part, a representation which gave
a curiously thrilling quality to the tale not appreciable
when told in print, admirably as it is told in the author's
famous book.</p>

<p>When the voice of the speaker ceased, as it did all
too soon, the silent, fascinated audience, aroused from
its strange African dream, broke into round after round
of hearty, appreciative applause. For several moments
the lecturer stood in a grave, thoughtful attitude, gazing
intently upon the moving throng, not as though idly
observing the dispersion of a village gathering, but as
some philosophic tourist from another sphere, studying
the aspect, the attitude, characteristic manner and physiognomical
traits of an alien race. He asked but one
question. Turning eagerly to the gentleman who accompanied
him, he inquired with an expression of intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
interest, as his glance fell upon a graceful Kentuckienne
near the center of the throng&mdash;a lovely blonde with exquisite
complexion, hair and eyes&mdash;"Who is our beautiful
Scandinavian?"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The answer seemed to please him, and
he walked thoughtfully toward the door, an object of
respectful attention from the slow-moving throng, lingering
as if it longed to stay. Though of small stature,
he would have attracted attention anywhere. His figure
was compact, lithe, elastic, and perfectly erect, his cranial
outline (typically French) denoted intellectual strength and
physical vigor, his facial contour was bold, regular, and
pleasing&mdash;a singularly virile countenance softened and
dignified by the discipline of thought. The crowd of
which he is now the central figure is composed largely
of men wholly different from Du Chaillu in air, stature,
carriage, countenance, complexion, and racial type. Yet
Nature seldom evolves from any source a solider bit of
man than this gallant Frenchman from the heart of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The distinguished guest took his departure on the
following day, not with a cold adieu, but with an airy
<i lang="fr">au revoir</i>&mdash;as of one who, charmed with his welcome,
was meditating an early return. But was he pleased?
Apparently he <em>was</em>, and if not, he had the Frenchman's
happy art of <em>seeming to be</em>. If here simply for observation,
he certainly found no degeneracy, but rather, we
should say, certain pleasing lines of variation in the Occidental
evolution of the race. It seems impossible that
he should not have had a pleasant impression of his hosts&mdash;these
genial sons of "Arcady," forever piping their minty
elixirs with oaten straws, whose drinks even when "straightest"
were not stronger than their steady heads&mdash;so hospitable
to strangers, so chivalrous to women, so courteous
to men, so gracious in manner, so happy in speech, so
loyal to kin, so proud of their Commonwealth, their
ancestral traditions, and their indomitable race. They
drank naught from the skulls of their enemies, but they
were adepts in filling their own. Their potations were
pottle deep, and the intervals between were not needlessly
prolonged. And yet they rose refreshed from
their heady cups, ordered their stud a drench, and sighed
for work.</p>

<p>The adventurous Frenchman was no glutton in debauch,
but in a modest symposium could always hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
his own, and doubtless imagined in this festal reunion of
Bourbon and Champagne that he had re-discovered the

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h2>


<p>In the early autumn of 1889, the writer of this paper
had the good fortune to be present at the Newcastle
meeting of the British Association. Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
standing at the very gateway of Scotland and looking
out from the Tyne upon the great North Sea, is a famous
old city in English history, that lay directly in the path
of conquest and migration and was literally cradled in
war, alternately rocked by Scandinavian or Dane, Saxon
or Norman, Englishman or Scot. To-day it is big, prosperous,
and progressive; even in the midst of peace perpetually
sounding the note of preparation for war. True
to its oldest and best traditions it is staunchly loyal to
the Crown, proudly proclaiming its fealty on every coast,
from the mouths of mighty guns cast in its own Cyclopean
shops. From the days of the Scandinavian sea-rover
through centuries of ruthless conflict she has stood out
stoutly against the enemies of England, just as to-day
her long sea-front of solid wall resists the encroachments
of the Northern sea.</p>

<p>Here the shipbuilder is ceaselessly busy, constructing
in his immense yards the great modern ship with its
heart of fire and frame of steel. In any large yards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
whole scheme of construction in all its branches may
be seen at a glance, from the laying of the keel to the
launching of the ship. The best work in modern engineering
can be seen on the Tyne; and this is not surprising
when we remember that upon the banks of this
river the Locomotive was born, giving to this aggressive
contemporary people a command of the earth as complete
as their immemorial mastery of the sea. So enormous
is the demand for fuel in the shipyards of the North-east
Coast that it will take but a few centuries of work
in these busy shops to exhaust the supply. The old
proverb has lost its point. The most careless or unobservant
tourist may see the steam-drawn trains "carrying
their coals" to Newcastle, <em>now</em>, at all hours.</p>

<p>Nor does the Northern farmer sit with idle hands.
All industries rest upon him. The farms are small, but
the joint product is large. Thousands of farm laborers
in Northumberland have each their "three acres and a
cow." The Northern cattle-market in Newcastle would
have filled the Highland caterans with delight. The
weekly supply of cattle exceeds two thousand; the number
of sheep is not less than twenty thousand. This was
nearly twenty years ago. What must it be now? But
even thus, how it speaks for the varied gifts and exhaustless
vigor and vitality of this old Northumbrian race!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Their rage for "river improvement" carries a lesson for
men of their blood elsewhere. Between 1860 and 1889
the material dredged from the bed of the river Tyne
amounted to more than <em>eighty millions</em> of tons. "Now,"&mdash;it
was said at the Newcastle meeting&mdash;"there are more
vessels entering and leaving this port <em>than any other in
the world</em>." Among the outgoing vessels at that time was
a gallant Norwegian barque which bore the name of
"Longfellow." A few years before&mdash;a score, perhaps&mdash;the
writer had seen upon a famous track in Kentucky
a racer of great note who bore the same illustrious name&mdash;almost
a contemporaneous compliment from widely
separate branches of the same race. But what more enduring
than the singer's own verse?&mdash;</p>

<p>A fit place of meeting&mdash;this old gateway of the North&mdash;for
a select body of England's brilliant, busy, clear-headed
and practical savants, and especially for that marvelously
fruitful mid-century "section" which here first received
supreme scientific recognition, having been organized at
the Newcastle meeting by the British Association in 1863.</p>

</div>

<p>Though the youngest of the sections, its proceedings
are singularly fascinating and the attendance always
large. The meeting was held in the reading-room of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Free Library. Upon a long, low platform to the left of
the entrance there sat facing the audience, a group, not of
"scientists," but of really scientific men, their names as
familiar to the English reading world as household words.
The central figure of the group, Sir William Turner of
Edinburgh, was the chairman of the section&mdash;a man of
striking personality, who read a paper on Weismann and
his theories which was listened to with closest attention,
the novelty of the doctrines eliciting many expressions of
doubt or dissent, though presented by the author of the
paper with singular lucidity, fairness, and force. Sir
William graced his position well, not merely by reason of
intellectual gifts, but by virtue of a personal dignity
which admirably comported with his commanding presence.
He was a large, handsome man, with a robust
frame, an erect carriage, and a notably aggressive air.
Seated near him, and firmly supporting his somewhat
heavy presence, were a number of men with world-renowned
names&mdash;Francis Galton, famous for his studies in heredity
and the publication of an epochal work; Sir Henry Acland,
a learned anthropologist and medical scholar&mdash;a thinker
of deep and varied scientific resource; Boyd Dawkins,
the pioneer "Cave Hunter" and writer upon prehistoric
archæology; John Evans, an able, learned, and industrious
writer upon archæological themes; Doctor Bruce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the eminent historian of the Roman Wall; General Pitt
Rivers, equally famous as soldier and savant, a quiet,
dark-faced gentleman of easy, pleasant manners, dressed
in the plainest fashion and judiciously expending an income
of £30,000 a year. His large benefactions for scientific
purposes made him truly a Prince of Science, gracious,
munificent, and wise. The most striking and conspicuous
figure in this solid English line was George Romanes,
then in his prime and in apparently perfect health, tall,
erect, dark-haired, with pale, handsome features and
scholarly, high-bred air&mdash;a most impressive personification
of intellectual pride and strength. As he sat in the
midst of that animated group, cold, proud, silent but
keenly observant, he vividly recalled the figure of the
famous Kentuckian who once presided over the United
States Senate, calmly noting the portents of impending
war. In both, one easily discerned the same high qualities
of intellect, resolution, and reserved force. By the
side of the stately Romanes there sat the learned and
vivacious Canon Isaac Taylor, slender, gray-haired, keen-eyed,
alert, humorous, and full of tact&mdash;one of those
clerical scholars and gentlemen who have done so much
for English literature and have been a characteristic charm
of English social life&mdash;men most admirably depicted by
the novelist Bulwer in his better moods. Canon Taylor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
was the most animated figure in this noble English group.
Near him sat two foreigners, each in curiously striking
contrast with the other; one of these, a tall, ruddy, broad-shouldered
blonde, with a strong, lithe, well-knit frame,
an eager, alert expression, and a somewhat restless air,
was the celebrated Scandinavian explorer Fridjof Nansen,
then just twenty-six years of age, but already made world-famous
by his recent explorations in the polar seas. At
the left of the young Scandinavian, and presenting a
remarkable contrast to that impressive figure, there sat
a somewhat older man of small stature, of compact, vigorous
frame, of clear, dark complexion, keen, clear, thoughtful
eyes, and features typically French. The reader
recognizes the description at once. It is our old friend,
Du Chaillu, who has come to the northern coast of England,
and standing in the very pathway of old Scandinavian
invasions and confronting some of England's best
thinkers upon their own ground, has calmly looked out
upon the "grim&mdash;troubled" sea of England's Saxon King
and boldly proclaimed his theory of the direct Scandinavian
origin of the English race.</p>

<p>It was the sensational paper of the day, and even
the most phlegmatic English scholar was stirred by this
defiant bugle-blast from a philosophic French explorer who
was not only disturbing the settled convictions of Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>lish
thinkers, but still worse was running counter to cherished
prejudices of the English race. That historic hyphenation
of racial appellatives&mdash;"Anglo-Saxon"&mdash;was a sacred
immemorial conjunction of names representing a fusion
of racial elements not to be shaken asunder by a blast
upon the ram's horn of a wandering Gaul. The assault
was not altogether "Pickwickian"; but the Frenchman
was a stout antagonist, and found an incidental confirmation
of his theory in the occasional flash of Berserker
rage which followed his masterly game of parry and thrust.
Nor was he ill-equipped for his controversial work. From
certain antiquities which he had found during his recent
explorations in the North he inferred the existence of
commercial relations between the Northmen of that
period and the peoples of the Mediterranean Sea, Rome
and Greece being at that time in direct communication
with these seafaring peoples of the North. The tribes
of Germania, on the contrary, were "a shipless people,"
and according to the Roman writers were still in an
uncivilized state. He said there were settlements in
Britain by the Northmen during the Roman occupation;
that England was always called by the Northmen
one of their Northern lands; that the language of the
North and of England were similar in the early times;
that the early Northern Kings claimed part of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
as their own; that the Northmen were bold and enterprising
navigators, pushing their explorations wherever
a ship could survive the perils of the sea. On the
contrary, neither the Saxons nor the Franks were a
seafaring people, either at the time of Charlemagne or
at any earlier period.</p>

<div class="caption">GENERAL GEORGE ROGERS CLARK.</div>

<p>It was this Scandinavian element which had infused
a spirit of enterprise into the <em>English race that they had
never lost</em>, and which had made it in all its branches, wherever
they had sailed their fleets or pushed their invading
columns, the invincible masters of earth and sea. Its
resistless movement across the American continent, he
declared, was the most dramatic spectacle in history.</p>

<p>This, in brief, was the Frenchman's startling theory;
first broached in England on the borders of that rude
North Sea which the Vikings had swept in early days,
and upon the banks of the peaceful Tyne, where many
a Scandinavian rover had moored his little barque. The
discussion of M. Du Chaillu's paper took a wide range,
all the distinguished ethnologists present&mdash;Dawkins, Taylor,
Turner, Evans, Galton, and others&mdash;participating in
this rattling ethnological debate. Du Chaillu, who had
very much the attitude of a French <em>suspect</em> in a German
camp, maintained throughout his Gallic <em>aplomb</em>, listening
with admirable composure and with apparent interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
though his dark skin visibly reddened at times under the
critical lash, however courteously applied. Canon Taylor,
who evidently was in full sympathy with Du Chaillu's
startling views, gave a happy turn to the little imbroglio
by a cleverly parodied quotation from Tennyson's Welcome
to the Sea-King's Daughter from over the Sea&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse"><span class="i0">We are all of us <em>one in our welcome of thee</em>,"<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the closing line being given with a politely sympathetic
inclination of the head toward the gentleman from France,
and with a gracious smile more expressive than his words&mdash;the
smile interpreting to his hearers the startling disclaimer:
"It is nothing to me." The clever ecclesiast
read a very learned paper at the same meeting on a similar
theme, and the two gentlemen who sat near him, Du
Chaillu and Nansen, were ideal representatives of two
of his four ethnological types, the Auvergnat type of
Central France and the long-headed Scandinavian of the
North. Indeed, as a matter for courteous rational discussion
the question of "Saxon or Norse" had the profoundest
interest for the amiable savant, who seemed
to possess in perfection that fine philosophical quality
of intellect which the French have happily termed <i lang="fr">justesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
d'esprit</i>&mdash;a quality of mind in which even the ablest
disputant may sometimes be deficient.</p>

<p>But, nothing disconcerted by criticism or compliment,
M. Du Chaillu remarked, with cold dignity, as he
rose in final response: "Opinions, gentlemen, may differ
in England from opinions in France, but the truth on
both sides of the Channel is the same"&mdash;a sentiment to
which all present responded with that fine sympathy
and with that perfect courtesy "wherein&mdash;to derogate
from none&mdash;the true heroic English gentleman hath no
peer."</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h2>


<p>"Every schoolboy" (to quote Macaulay) is familiar
with the salient facts in the history of the Normans;
their origin in Scandinavia; the seizure of a fertile
province in France (wrung from a <i lang="fr">fainéant</i> heir of
Charlemagne); their extraordinary evolution as the great
ethnic force of the period; their absolute mastery of sea
and land on every shore, from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Red Sea, and notably their Conquest of England,
their perfect fusion with the conquered peoples, and
the resulting evolution of the English race. All this
is commonplace to every historical reader. But recent
investigators, going deeper, have inquired if the laws,
institutions, language, and material constructions which
mark the pathway of Norman conquest are simply
the memorials of an extinct race? Is the Norman still
living, still powerful, progressive, and prolific? Or is it
an exhausted racial force, pithless, impotent, and effete,
with no recognizable evidence of its ancient prepotency
in racial struggles for existence in the conflicts of the
past? Or, in a word, is it, as Mr. Freeman affirms, a
Lost Race? The answer to these questions depends
largely upon the answer to other queries, to wit: Was
the conquest and sequential settlement of England merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a military invasion? or was it a vast popular migration
such as America has witnessed in later times? or was it
not in point of fact both&mdash;an invasion and a migration,
the one following the other?</p>

<p>England was not conquered in a day. The battle
of Hastings was decisive, but not conclusive. There
was a long and bloody struggle before the invading force.
Nearly <em>four</em> years (the duration of our "Civil War") of
close, desperate fighting must be encountered before the
work of subjugation could be declared complete. Every
gap in the ranks of the invader must be filled by the importation
of forces from abroad. There was a perpetual
draft upon the Continental populations, and a ceaseless
"rushing of troops to the front," precisely as in the
protracted "War between the States." All Europe had
become the recruiting ground of the Conqueror. He was
peopling England even in the midst of war; and when
the period of "reconstruction" came the stream of migration
continued to flow. England was the bourn from
which no <em>immigrant</em> returned; and under the military
or reconstructive methods of the Conqueror, every <em>invader</em>
was permanently planted upon the soil.</p>

<p>Apparently, these considerations furnish a conclusive
answer to certain critical objections which shall be cited
as we proceed. The facts upon which our conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
rest are found, chiefly, in the official records of England
and in the authentic annals of the Anglo-Norman races.</p>

<p>Here, then, we must infer the existence of an immense
multitude of Norman immigrants mingling and eventually
fusing with the subjugated race. What has been the result
of this intimate commingling of ethnic elements upon
English soil? Is it possible that so daring and successful
a gamester as the Norman was lost in the shuffle when
an auspicious destiny was directing the game? The writer
of this paper thinks that he found in the great Library
of the British Museum evidence that the Norman people
are still a power upon this planet; to be as carefully
counted with in the struggles of the future as in the
conflicts of the past.</p>

<p>Recent investigation has disclosed the fact that contemporary
records in England and Normandy&mdash;records
of two different countries of seven hundred years' standing,
relating to different branches of the same race&mdash;are
so minutely detailed as to enable the philosophic enquirer
"to trace the identity of families and even individuals, in
two countries." And this has been done by placing the
Great Rolls of the Norman Exchequer in juxtaposition with
similar English records of the Twelfth Century. This comparative
juxtaposition of contemporary official records of
kindred races geographically separate has been made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
basis of an alphabetical series of English or Anglo-Norman
surnames, which is remarkably full, though necessarily
incomplete since the compiler, a very able English
scholar, was not in position to enumerate all the families
then extant; but it contains five times as many names
as the famous Battle Abbey Roll, and conclusively shows
that the ancestry of the intellectual aristocracy of England
was Norman. The Anglo-Saxon and the Dane were
shown to be in a hopeless minority. The enquiry which
resulted in the compilation of the alphabetical list was
restricted entirely to surnames of a purely Norman origin
still existing in England. A third or more of this
English population is Norman, directly descended from
the Norman migration that preceded, accompanied, or followed
the Conquest.</p>

<p>Can evidence be more conclusive that the Norman
was neither extinguished nor absorbed by the sluggish
Saxon who accepted his yoke?</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Hardy, in his powerful fiction, "Tess,"
plainly accepts the conclusiveness of these views. His
heroine, though of humble origin, clearly owed her involuntary
seductiveness and fatal charm to the transmitted
potency of her Norman blood, and it is said that in certain
secluded parts of England may be found to-day
rural or village populations of the same class gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
about some old Norman castle, donjon, or keep; their
Norman descent distinctly visible in their inherited personal
traits; a certain characteristic combination of intellect,
courage, beauty, and social charm distinguishing
them at a glance from the dull, heavy, long-bodied, short-legged,
unshapely Saxon of a neighboring town or shire.
The same restless blood or the same spirit of adventure
which brought the Scandinavian to Normandy and the
Norman to English soil, in time drove him to the great
settlements beyond the Atlantic Sea&mdash;settlements known
by the English of to-day as "The States." Their brethren
in Ireland followed in great numbers at a later day, and,
wherever in recent wars the American flag has been
unfurled, "the fighting race" has stood beneath its folds&mdash;always
in force and always at the front, each with the
line of battle beneath his feet and the fire of battle in
his eye.</p>

<p>Thither, too, came the indomitable Scot, precisely as
he came in the Colonial and Revolutionary days. "The
Lowland race," says Mackintosh, "Briton and <span class="smcap">Norman</span>
and Saxon and Dane, gave the world a new man&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Sea Rover, the Border Soldier, the Pioneer....
The folk speech, from Northumberland to the Clyde and
the Forth, is Northern English or Lowland Scotch; and
the future man of Bannockburn and <span class="smcap">King's Mountain</span>
is beginning to appear. He is the man with the blood
of the Sea Rover mixed with the blood of the Borderer,
and the soldier, the scholar and thinker, the statesman
and lawyer, the trader and farmer." He is the man that
crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains as a pioneer. He is
the man that sat in the conventions that organized the
State, and stood in an unbroken line in all the pioneer
battles of his race. The earliest migration of the Anglo-Norman
folk was to the Colony of Virginia, as many of
the old Virginian surnames, Bacon, Baskerville, Boys
(Bois), Cabell, Clay, etc., clearly attest; and the State of
Kentucky deriving a large population of English descent
from Virginia, we should naturally find a strong infusion
of Anglo-Norman blood in the people of this State&mdash;an
inference fully sustained by the transcript of Anglo-Norman
surnames which the writer made from the list that
he found in the great Library in London.</p>

<p>The late Professor Shaler is frequently quoted to the
effect that ethnological research discloses the existence
in Kentucky of the largest body of nearly pure English
folk to be found on the face of the globe&mdash;that has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
separated for two hundred years from the parent English
stock. But the facts do not warrant the assumption
that the Kentuckian is of purely "Anglo-Saxon" derivation.
In <em>him</em>, at least, the blood of the Norman is
not wholly lost. He <em>is</em>, however, as Professor Shaler
says, an "Elizabethan" Englishman.</p>

<p>We print elsewhere a list of names familiar to Kentuckians,
which clearly points to the same general conclusion.
With more leisure and space this list might
be greatly extended.</p>

<p>But what are the characteristic traits of the Norman
as we find him in his early habitat in France? We
are told by a contemporary observer&mdash;Geoffrey Malaterra&mdash;that
the typical or "composite" Norman of his
day was prodigiously astute, a passionate lover of litigation,
an eloquent speaker, skilled in diplomacy, sagacious
in council, convincing in debate; a son of the Church,
but not too deferential to prelates nor too precise in the
observance of ecclesiastical forms; a bold and tireless
litigant, but not over-scrupulous in his methods of procedure
and not always strictly judicial in his construction
of the law. "If he was born a soldier," said Edward
Freeman, "he was also a born lawyer." In spite of this
pronounced legal <em>penchant</em> he was swift (if not restrained)
to disregard and override the law; in the phrase of the
old chronicler, the <i lang="la">gens</i> was <i lang="la">effrenatissima</i>&mdash;recklessly wild,
unbridled and dangerous, <i lang="la">nisi jugo justitiæ prematur</i>; daring,
resolute, destructive in mutiny or revolt; seditious,
piratical or even revolutionary, unless the reins of government
were in strong and competent hands.</p>

<p>We had a notable mid-century exemplification of this
"unbridled" quality of temper in the introductory <em>razzia</em>
of Lopez at Cardenas. When the Kentuckians, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
unerring rifles had crumpled up the Spanish cavalry and
successfully covered the slow retreat of Lopez to the sea,
were followed by the pursuing warship <i>Pizarro</i> into the
harbor of Key West, nothing daunted they coolly seized
the United States fort, took possession of its batteries,
and deliberately trained its guns upon the Spanish man-of-war.
<i lang="la">Gens effrenatissima</i>, indeed. The fighting habits
of the Liberators were notoriously loose (especially under
tropical suns); but what is to be particularly noted in
this instance is, that the reins of power in our highly civilized
government were unpardonably lax. It is possible,
however, that the reckless and "unbridled" conduct of
the Kentuckians was due, in part, to the circumstance
that the chaplain of the Expedition had been killed.</p>

<p>The subsequent official investigation showed to the
entire satisfaction of our Anglo-Norman lawyers that
practically everything had been done under "the forms
of law."</p>

<p>The word <i lang="la">effrenatus</i> was almost overworked by Cicero.
It perfectly described the Catilines of old Rome and the
banded ruffians that wrought their will. But in his very
lawlessness the Norman of Malaterra never forgot the
<em>law</em>. He scrupulously observed its "forms." Even the
Conquest of England was "justified" by a pronunciamento
of legal assumptions subtly and elaborately drawn. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Norman was a shrewd and successful trafficker, and this
tradition of commercial skill and thrift is current in Normandy
to-day. When he settled on English soil or sailed
in English ships he did not lose his inherited commercial
instincts. He made England the trading nation that
she is. An eminent Kentuckian, who bore the distinctive
marks of Norman blood, once said to a group of keenly
attentive listeners, "The meanest of all aristocracies is
a commercial aristocracy." A like disparaging conception
of a powerful adversary was implied in the remark
attributed to Napoleon, that "the English were a nation
of shop-keepers"&mdash;<i lang="fr">un peuple marchand</i>. It was this same
race of innocuous Anglo-Norman traffickers that crushed
Napoleon's iron columns at Waterloo, and forever closed
his conquering career. But the Norman, who was a
soldier, a lawyer, a diplomatist, orator, hunter, horseman
and trader, was also a successful cultivator of the soil,
and the Norman agriculturist of to-day who reminds the
tourist in his physical traits, hair, eyes, and complexion,
and even in the intonations of his voice, of an English
farmer of the Anglo-Norman type, bears a more striking
resemblance to his English kinsman indeed than to his
dark-visaged compatriot, the <i lang="fr">vigneron</i> of Southern France.
We must add, to complete the portraiture left us by
Malaterra, that the Norman was a passionate lover of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
horses, of the breed immortalized by the genius of Bonheur;
a bold equestrian, skilled in the use of arms; at
home upon the sea, and literally reared in the lap of war.
And he was also a brilliant orator, passionately fond of
eloquent speech. From his early boyhood, says the
chronicler, he assiduously cultivated his natural aptitude
for that persuasive art, that power of ready and effective
utterance which, though often profane, made him
dominant in the councils of war and of peace; in the
cabinets of diplomacy, and even in the chamber of the
King. <i lang="la">Gens astutissima</i> beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>To return to our beginning&mdash;what think you was in
the mind of Paul Du Chaillu as he stood that memorable
evening before an audience of mid-century Kentuckians?&mdash;this
philosophic thinker who had been for years a critical
observer of "the most dramatic spectacle in history"&mdash;the
sweeping, ceaseless, transcontinental march of the
Anglo-Norman race&mdash;what did he think of the environing
conditions as he stood in that old Courthouse which
had resounded with the eloquence of Anglo-Norman
orators; which had echoed and re-echoed generation after
generation to the "Oyez!" "Oyez!" of Anglo-Norman
sheriffs? and which was still standing, an impressive
memorial of days when the ground upon which it was
built was the camping-ground of the dominant figure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
this Westward march&mdash;the Anglo-Norman leader Boone
or "Bohun"&mdash;a name which in its very sound or utterance
(<i lang="la">mugitus boum</i>) was in "dark and bloody" times
a challenge to mortal combat&mdash;a deep bellowing defiance
of "battle to the death"?</p>

<p>What were his thoughts as he looked with wondering
eyes upon that charming Southern matron with her fair,
delicate features and high-bred air? Was the vision a vivid
reminder of blue-eyed "Scandinavian" maidens with faces
as white as their native snows and locks with the softened
shimmer of the midnight sun? One must acknowledge
that the very exquisiteness of form and tint made this
a rare type, even in Kentucky, but there were many
interesting variations of it to be seen at our great mid-century
"Fairs"&mdash;from the rich "auburn" of Marie Stuart
to the "carroty" tresses of the Virgin Queen&mdash;framing
lovely faces and crowning tall, willowy figures of queenly
mold. But probably the prevailing tint of hair was
that ascribed by the wizard romancer to the Lady Rowena&mdash;with
her dash of Scandinavian blood&mdash;something between
flaxen and brown; all in clear and brilliant contrast with
a type that glowed with the superb brunette finish of
Southern and Central France. Had Du Chaillu been with
us in earlier days we could have shown him likewise
figures of a striking masculine type&mdash;tall, soldierly figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that might have graced the "Viking age"&mdash;men who,
after the fashion of early Norman days, would have been
equally at home in camp or court. One of these gallant
gentlemen, whom many of us remember, was in some
respects a striking counterpart of a Scandinavian sailor
that figures in a late romance, "Wolf Larsen"; like him
even in the soubriquet prefixed to his Scandinavian name;
of gigantic stature and strength; big-brained, passionate,
strong-willed, energetic, proud, combative and sagacious,
with a deep instinctive love of the sea. But his chronic
irascibility of temper, often manifest on trifling provocation
in unbridled bursts of Berserker rage, sadly marred
the brilliancy of his military career, and engendered deep
and implacable enmities which brought his career as a
soldier to a speedy and tragical close.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/f_032.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">GOVERNOR ISAAC SHELBY.</div>
</div>

<p>In other respects he radically differed from Norsemen
of the Wolf Larsen type. In his relations with his family
and friends he was delicate, generous, and kind; the tenderest
of sons, the kindest brother, the most devoted and
loyal of friends: a lover of literature, music, and the
finer pleasures of social life. Strangest of all, he was
reverent and devout. He respected the forms of the
Church, and every night, even in the rude environment
of the camp, he knelt beside his soldier's couch and repeated
the Lord's Prayer. But the soubriquet fastened upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
him both by resentful enemies and admiring friends recalls
his fictitious counterpart&mdash;Wolf Larsen. Whenever the
name of the Federal commander came up for discussion
during our great Civil War&mdash;whether in Confederate
camp or by Kentucky firesides, or by the campfires of
his own loyal division&mdash;he was invariably known, by
reason of his huge figure, his big bovine head, his flaming
black eyes, his fierce, tumultuous energies, his headlong
courage and gigantic strength, by the soubriquet "Bull"&mdash;BULL
NELSON&mdash;a sea-trained soldier with a bellowing
soubriquet prefixed to an honored racial name&mdash;a mid-century
Kentuckian, who in mediæval battle might have
swung the battle-axe of Front-de-B&oelig;uf.</p>

<p>There were many others&mdash;Kentuckians of an ideal
Anglo-Norman type&mdash;who would have brought to M. Du
Chaillu the strongest confirmation of his philosophic views
had he visited us during the cyclonic "sixties," or in
that halcyon interlude "before the war."</p>

<p>Returning now to the discussion of the masterly paper
read by M. Du Chaillu at the British Association,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> we
may consider certain aspects of the question more in
detail; conceding at the same time full credit to the
ability of the disputants who dissented from the views
expressed by the foreign savant. M. Du Chaillu was peculiarly
fortunate in his critics. If his theory should survive
the searching and trenchant criticisms of such men, his
scholarship would command respect even if they should
decline to accept his conclusions in full.</p>

<p>A loyal Briton does not lightly abandon what he conceives
to be established or traditional views. This trait
does not imply defect of philosophic insight or want of
wide research. It denotes simply the influence of prepossession,
opinionated habit, and conscious power. Nor
is this influence unusual. Scholars differ even as "doctors"
disagree. Dr. George Craik, whose name is familiar to
every scholar of the English race, was liberal enough to
concede, a quarter of a century before the advent of Du
Chaillu as a Scandinavian protagonist, that the English
language might have more of a Scandinavian than of a
purely Germanic character; or, in other words, "more
nearly resembled the Danish or Swedish than the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
German." The invading bands, he adds, by whom the
dialect was originally brought over into Britain in the
Fifth and Sixth centuries, were in all probability drawn
in great part from the Scandinavian countries. At a
still later date, too, this English population was directly
and largely recruited from Denmark and the regions
around the Baltic. Eastern and Northern England, from
the middle of the Ninth Century, "was as much Danish
as English." In the Eleventh Century the sovereign
was a Dane.</p>

<p>M. Du Chaillu's theory rests upon other and perhaps
stronger grounds, but these concessions from a thoughtful
scholar at least will carry weight. The continuous existence
of Scandinavian influence in England is suggestive
of the circumstance that the Danish conquest of England
preceded the Norman conquest by "exactly half a century."
An Englishman (Odericus Vitalis), writing almost contemporaneously
with the Norman conquest, describes
his countrymen as having been found by the Normans
"a rustic and almost illiterate people" (<i lang="la">agrestes et pene
illiteratos</i>). And yet, says Dr. Craik, the dawn of the
revival of letters in England may properly be dated from
a point about fifty years antecedent to the Norman conquest.
To what, then, must be ascribed this scholastic
renascence? Very clearly to the intimate relations estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>lished
between England and Normandy by Edward the
Confessor. But there is no trace of the new literature
(that of the Arabic school which was prevalent in Europe)
having found its way to England "before the Norman
conquest swept into the benighted old kingdom, carrying
the torch of learning in its train." The name of Lanfranc
alone gives splendor to that civilization which his genius
created for the English race. He not only lighted the
torch of learning, but he strengthened the reins of power.
He restrained the lawless impetuosity of William the
Conqueror; he imposed iron conditions upon the accession
of William Rufus; he checked the atrocities, and finally
broke the power, of Odo of Bayeux. His work was well
done, and its effects are visible to this day. He was the
real power behind the throne. It is not easy, says an
eminent English writer, to trace through the length of
centuries "the measureless and invisible benefits which the
life of one scholar bequeaths to the world." But such was
the life, the work, the bequest of this Norman scholar,
who died honored and beloved even by the rude, sullen,
and implacable race which had been subjugated by the
Norman kings. But Dr. Craik, with all his liberality
and learning, is not disposed to accept the theory of a
great migration or settlement preceding, or accompanying
or following, the Norman conquest in the Eleventh Cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>tury.
To be sure, this theory was not elaborately or
effectively presented until of late years; but Dr. Craik,
writing as far back as the opening of our "War between
the States," seems to contradict this theory by anticipation&mdash;"In
point of fact, the Normans never transferred
themselves in a body, or generally, to England. It was
never thus taken possession of by the Normans. It was
never colonized by these foreigners, or occupied by them
in any other than a military sense. It received a foreign
government, but not at all a new population." Yet even
Dr. Craik seems to appreciate the lesson of "names." He
thinks it remarkable, for instance, that though we find
a good many names of natives of Gaul in connection with
the last age of Roman literature, scarcely a British name
has been preserved. Even in Juvenal's days the pleaders
of Britain were trained by the eloquent scholars of Gaul.
The significance of a name in determining family origin
is a common assumption of our familiar speech. "That is
a <em>Virginian</em> name," we say; and if we find many Virginian
names in a given locality we naturally infer that the town,
or the county, or the locality, large or small, was originally
settled by Virginians. In one of our old Bluegrass counties
two of these settlements were made in pioneer times,
about two miles apart. One is known as "Jersey Ridge,"
the other as "Tuckahoe." If in both localities we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
an English stock with Anglo-Norman names we should
naturally assume a common derivation from the Anglo-Norman
branch of the great British race.</p>

<p>But that accomplished philologist, Dr. Craik, seems to
be quite in sympathy with the views of Du Chaillu touching
the ancestral relations of the Scandinavian to the
English race; and Dr. Craik's eminent American compeer,
Mr. George P. Marsh, is not hopelessly wedded to fixed
conclusions, and has by no means overlooked the obvious
Scandinavian affinities of the English tongue. "Almost
every sound," says the latter, "which is characteristic of
English orthoëpy, is met with in one or other of the Scandinavian
languages, and almost all their peculiarities,
except those of intonation, <em>are found in English</em>; while
between our articulation and that of the German dialects
the most nearly related to the <em>Anglo-Saxon</em> there are many
irreconcilable discrepancies." If to determine the relative
proportions of linguistic and ethnic elements in dialect
and race were "a hopeless and unprofitable task," this
would seem to invalidate all general conclusions in the
matter.</p>

<p>A few days after the very lively discussion of M. Du
Chaillu's epochal paper in the Free Library of Newcastle,
there appeared in a great newspaper a contemporary
estimate of his views, which was received by its multi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>tudinous
constituency with profound interest and respect.
It was the rolling voice of "the Thunderer"&mdash;the famous
London <cite>Times</cite>. In all crises in the national life, the
influence of this journal is felt. It is not a mere priestly
oracle, silent except at times, but a divinity that never
ceases to speak; clothed with strangely beneficent powers,
and in the exercise of legitimate influence as resistless as
the fabled might of the Scandinavian Thor. It <em>forms</em>
opinion;&mdash;it <em>fixes</em> opinion;&mdash;it <em>reflects</em> opinion;&mdash;it gives
effect to the popular will. It has been felicitously characterized
as the "vast shadow of the public mind."</p>

<p>On the 21st of September, 1889, the <cite>Times</cite>, after a
full report of the ethnological discussion in Section H, had
this to say by way of editorial comment: "Perhaps the
great sensation of the Section was M. Du Chaillu's paper,
intended to prove that we are <em>all Scandinavians</em>....
This paper, combined with that of Canon Taylor, and the
discussion that followed both, seemed to show that the
time is ripe for a perfectly new investigation of the whole
question of the origin and migration of the races which
inhabit Europe and Asia; and, that, on lines in which
language will play only a subordinate part."</p>

<p>Thus much for the startling theory discussed by the
Anthropological Section at Newcastle.</p>

<p>In a subsequent correspondence, which appeared in
the London <cite>Times</cite>, M. Du Chaillu challenged archæologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to point out remains in any other part of Europe so like
those of the early Anglo-Saxons in England as the relics
he figures from Scandinavia in England. It is not always
easy to indicate with precision the cradle of an ancient
race; and even if such remains were found on the coasts
of Holland and North Germany, the discovery would not
seriously affect the conclusions that seem to have been
reached as to ancestral relations of the Scandinavian and
the Norman to the English race in England and the United
States. One might abandon altogether the main line of
M. Du Chaillu's argument, (1) his careful analysis of the
Sagas and other ancient documents and (2) his comparison
of the antiquities upon which the challenge rests, and
yet there would remain something more than a strong
presumption that the animating principle of the English
race, in its leading branches, is the Scandinavian blood.
It would seem to be quite in conformity with the law of
nature that the daring, crafty, and indomitable race which
still shapes the political destinies of men, which is historically
traceable in its schemes of conquest and subjugation
for a thousand years, and which is precisely traceable
upon geographical lines in its movements of colonization
or war, should have derived its enterprising characteristics
from the only race which has demonstrably transmitted
its conquering and colonizing traits within historic times:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to wit, the Scandinavian pirates that were conceived
upon stormy waters, spawned upon an icy coast, and
swept, apparently in a career of predestined conquest, from
the waters of the Baltic to the ends of the earth. The
nations shrank from the Rover in fear. The Frenchman,
at least, learned to dread his power, and the Saxon submitted
with sullen acquiescence to his rule. He sowed the
seed of conquest with his blood, and upon whatever shore
he drove his keel he planted himself fiercely upon the
soil to stay. Is it to be supposed for an instant that this
puissant racial force was dissipated and lost? Not so.
The light, the fire, the sweep, the coruscating energies,
the resistless currents, the driving forces are still there.
The power is not "off"!</p>

<p>Those were stirring days in the old Northumbrian
city by the sea. And to the utmost border of that ancient
kingdom the busy populations were alive with expectation
and hope. Little cared they for the Sea Rover now.
He no longer enjoyed, as once, the freedom of the city
and the sea. They were really as indifferent to the vexed
question as the philosophic Canon Taylor humorously
affected to be. The loquacious savants might settle
matters to suit themselves; but there was another question,
probably of equal importance, for popular consideration;
and a question of far greater moment too, to a man with
blood in his veins; a question which touched at once the
pocket and the heart; to wit, the last of the classic races
at Doncaster, the St. Leger and the great Yorkshire
Stakes. Will the Duke of Portland's "Donovan"&mdash;a
Southern horse of great beauty, speed, and "luck"&mdash;win
in the coming contest with "Chitabob," the pride and
hope of the North? There was anxiety in every face.
The touts had come from their work at Doncaster, and
Chitabob was reported to be lame; his old enemy (rheumatism)
had seized his foreleg; he was not equal to a canter:
could do only three hours' walk in the paddock near the
ring. In spite of the conditions and the resulting con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>sternation
of Chitabob's friends, his nervy young owner
insists that "matters are not so bad as they seem, and
the <em>horse will run</em>." Meantime, the betting is against him&mdash;two
to one on Donovan; in rapid sequence six&mdash;seven&mdash;ten
against Chitabob. The situation was highly sensational;
the state of excitement in Doncaster was intense;
even Chitabob's friend, "Guyon" (a noted sportsman),
had surrendered hope. The owner, young Mr. Perkins,
was alone undismayed; and the men of the stalls were
as game as the horse. "He can win on three legs,"
they declared. "I do not think so," said Guyon, "and
though common sense prompts me to go for Donovan, I
am full of hope and sympathy for Chitabob. The splendid
fellow has always carried my money, and I will back him
to-day. He is too grand a horse to let him run loose, but
it is very clear to my mind that Donovan will win."
The loyal sportsman proved to be an infallible prophet&mdash;<em>Chitabob
lost</em>.</p>

<p>As one looks intently upon such a scene as this, Doncaster
disappears and Kentucky rises on the eye. The
story of Chitabob recalls the traditions of Grey Eagle,
that superb and exquisite idol of the mid-century Kentuckian's
heart; his brilliant and exciting contest with
Wagner; his gallant start, his matchless stride, the vast
crowd, the wild applause;&mdash;"the strained tendon," the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
slackened speed, the failing strength&mdash;the lost race. But
the defeated racer was always (like Clay or Breckinridge)
the idol of the State;&mdash;<em>the Champion of Kentucky</em>&mdash;as
Chitabob was the Champion of the North.</p>

<p>Imported "Yorkshire" was, likewise, a famous horse
in the history of the Southern turf, and his blood still
mingles with that of our finest strains. We note in Kentucky
a noble reproduction of the old lines, both in man
and horse; it was entirely fit that such a Virginian as
Commodore Morgan should bestow such a gift as "Yorkshire"
upon such a Kentuckian as Henry Clay. It was
a gift for a king, and there were marks of royal lineage
in both man and horse; lines that were souvenirs of a
royal race. Traditions tell us, and the casual traveler
notes abundant proof of the fact, that the "typical Kentuckian"
is indebted for many of his traits to the old
Northumbrian blood. Even the familiar speech of the
Yorkshireman recalls much that is characteristic in the
dialect of Kentucky; as "mad," for angry or vexed;
"thick," for friendly or intimate; "thumping," for big;
"rattling good," for very good; "plump," for quite or
entirely, as "shot plump through"; "whole lot," for a
large number; "what's up?" for what's the matter? etc.
Were not these words and phrases conveyed by racial
migration from the North of England to Virginia and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Virginia to Kentucky in days lang syne? Have you
never heard among the old horsemen of the Bluegrass
the odd expression, "The colt will be two years old
next 'grass'"? "It is curious," says Mr. Marsh, "that
the same expression is used in <em>Scandinavia</em>." In Denmark
and Sweden, he adds, as well as in England, the
gentlemen of the chase and turf reckon the age of their
animals by "springs"&mdash;the season of verdure being the
ordinary "birth season" of the horse; and a colt, therefore,
is said to be so many years old next "grass."</p>

<p>The same writer informs us that the names of the two
brothers, Hengist and Horsa&mdash;both names of the genus
<em>horse</em>&mdash;are words in one or another form common to all
the Scandinavian dialects. A Danish colonel told Mr.
Marsh that in a company in his regiment there were two
privates bearing these names, who were as inseparable
in their association as the Hengist and Horsa of old. An
ardent theorist, like a jealous lover, may find confirmation
strong in trifles light as air. It is a far cry from old Scandinavia
to old Kentucky, but what brain is broad enough,
what spirit is subtle enough, to comprehend the variety
and infinitude of delicate, airy, intangible influences by
which the busy hands of destiny have brought them together?
Not the least of these agencies were affinities,
customs, explorations, battles, contests, migrations, and
the "wingy mysteries" of kindred names or words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward Lee Childe, in his admirable life of his kinsman,
General Robert Lee (Paris, France, 1874), says that in
1192 we find a Lionel Lee at the head of a company of
gentlemen accompanying Richard of the Lion-Heart in
his third Crusade. In the original the word here translated
"gentlemen" is <i lang="fr">gentilshommes</i>. A word of somewhat
different connotation from its English equivalent, but
sufficiently alike in meaning to justify the assumption
that England is indebted to Normandy for the word, and,
essentially, for what the word connotes or implies&mdash;<em>the
chief or leader of a family or gens</em>. The followers of Lionel
Lee were, therefore, a military élite. The original conception
of the word still lingers among the Anglo-Norman
races. That the word in its later English form has taken
on a finer sense is illustrated by the famous speech of the
Great Nicholas to Sir Hamilton Seymour. The diplomacy
of the Czar neither asked nor conceded conventional
guarantees. "Before all things," he said, "I am an English
gentleman" (<i lang="fr">un gentilhomme Anglais</i>). The word
"cavalierism," used by M. Taine, reminds us that
England, long before the Conquest, was indebted to Normandy
for the "Cavalier"; that the "man-on-horseback"
was the Cavalier; that the Cavalier and gentilhomme were
conspicuous in the ranks of the Conqueror, and, not to be
too precise, may be said to have come down the centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
together. In a certain conventional sense it is proper,
no doubt, to say that the Cavalier in England was a gentleman;
and, always, in Normandy <i lang="fr">un gentilhomme</i>. But
it was only in later days, as in the splendid epoch of the
Stuarts, that the qualities of the gentleman, fusing with
the character of the Cavalier, gave a peculiar dignity,
elevation, and distinction to the natural and recognized
leaders of the English race. But the bonniest cavalier,
undisciplined by social culture, had precisely those defects
of his qualities which the term "cavalierism" was invented
by Sir Walter Scott to express. The qualities depicted
in Esmond by Thackeray were not conspicuous in Scott's
portraiture of "Claverhouse" or "Montrose." Gentilhomme,
Cavalier, and Gentleman were descriptive terms
evolved under similar historic conditions, and derived
from the same linguistic source. An Anglo-Norman Kentuckian
who figured conspicuously in the late War between
the States humorously adjusted all differences as to the
proper designation in that day, by addressing his friends
in familiar conversation as "Gentle-homines," a felicitous
appellative not only for Kentuckians, but for friendly
Indians as well. The <em>effigies</em> of the "man-on-horseback"
(a familiar phrase in English ears) was officially introduced
to the English public by an English king, who in
everything save birth and blood was typically Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
himself. It is indelibly stamped upon the Great Seal of
England, and not upon one seal alone. The most casual
inspection of the famous Guildhall collection will show,
stamped upon Seal after Seal through a long succession
of Anglo-Norman kings, the same equestrian figure which,
obviously of Norman origin, had appeared in England
before the Conquest; and which centuries later was designed
by an Anglo-Norman engraver upon the Great Seal of the
American Confederate States. The artist was Wyon
(engraver to the Queen), and the original of the symbolic
figure was that immortal Cavalier, <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>&mdash;a
man of Anglo-Norman blood.</p>

<p>It may be said that Kentucky offered physical conditions
that were exceptional, for the production of
"Cavaliers."</p>

<p>A scientific explorer found upon the icy coast of the
Straits of Magellan a growth of English grass&mdash;fresh,
green, flourishing, and as full of fight for existence as the
stock or race from which it took its name. It was like
the grass described in the Hudibrastic skit of the bluegrass
Colonel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"Where bluegrass grew the winter through&mdash;<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And where it blooms in summer, too."<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was a species of <i>Poa</i>, closely akin in its characteristics
to <i>Poa Pratensis</i>, the famous Bluegrass of Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
&mdash;a cosmopolitan grass; at home everywhere, but always
seeking congenial skies; rooting itself firmly and clinging
tenaciously; standing in with the rich soils and the strong
races; unseating old sod; standing off all casual intruders;
driving out all competing grasses; casting its own lines in
pleasant places; dividing honors with <i>Zea Mays</i>, the
stateliest of all grasses, and yielding to no competition
save here and there to the cryptic, mossy growth that at
last covers with oblivion the homes and the tombs of men.
Even the grasping, aggressive <em>Poa</em> yields to the power of
<em>moss</em>; and mossback monstrosities may be found even
among the vigorous offshoots of the Anglo-Norman race.
Yet, was it not an extraordinary incident of the evolution
of our Western world that in the genesis of the Commonwealth
of Kentucky two such factors or agencies as the
<em>Race</em> and the <em>Grass</em>&mdash;inseparably linked&mdash;should be predestined
each to a special function in the common work?
"Either," said a sagacious observer from New England,
"no other land ever lent itself so easily to civilization as
the Bluegrass region, or it was <em>exceptionally fortunate in
its inhabitants</em>." The alternative suggests that if this
miracle of evolution be attributable to <em>either</em> of the causes
named&mdash;<em>civilizableness of the land or adaptableness of race</em>&mdash;then
there can be but one conclusion should the result
be ascribed to the operation of <em>both</em>. This speculative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
suggestion as to the genetic or determining element in
the evolution of the Bluegrass State came from the pen
of that gifted and genial writer, Charles Dudley Warner,
many years ago. He was then visiting Kentucky, and
reporting in a series of papers his observations, as a visitor,
for an influential publication in the East. Please note
this unconscious implication as to <em>grass</em> and <em>race</em> from
a philosophic tourist of the olden times. "Grass" or

<p>The continuous application of three acute and powerful
minds along the same line of thought, in the first half
of the last century&mdash;an unconscious or undesigned collaboration
(so to speak) of Lamarck, St. Beuve, and Hippolyte
Taine&mdash;evolved a marvelous instrument of critical and
philosophic research; furnishing for every capable thinker
a method adapted to the investigation of all subjects,
great and small; neglecting no phase, shrinking from
no interpretation, rejecting no authentic fact, and having
in perfection the magical quality of adjustment to conditions
described in the Arabian tale. In his English notes,
for example, M. Taine, if too frank, is singularly felicitous
and discriminative in his physical descriptions of certain
Anglican types of race&mdash;presenting, first, the beastly,
repulsive traits of the <em>MALE</em>; the lowering, dog-like physiognomy,
the huge jowl; the dull red eyes; the gluttonous
chops; the swinish snout, the congested facial tissues;
the gross, unwieldy figure, the bloated features and the
protuberant accumulations of abdominal fat&mdash;thus graphically
depicting, by way of philosophical illustration, an
anthropoid incarnation of animal appetite. The picture
is not flattering, but it certainly embodies some familiar
traits, of which it is entirely pardonable to make a philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>sophic
use. Next he introduces the Boadicean or Brobdingnagian
<em>FEMALE</em>&mdash;"broad, stiff, and destitute of
ideas"&mdash;with heavy features, lifeless, fishy eyes, coarse,
congested complexion, a clumsy figure, large feet, unshapely
hands, and an utter lack of style and taste&mdash;notably in
the bizarre combinations of color in her dress. Moreover,
he says, two out of every three have their feet shod
with stout masculine boots, and as to their long, projecting
teeth&mdash;huge white teeth&mdash;it is impossible to train
oneself to endure them. "Is this," he inquires philosophically,
"a cause or an effect of the carnivorous regime?"
Plainly enough the cause&mdash;the remote cause at least&mdash;the
determining cause, is what is designated by M. Taine
elsewhere as "the hereditary conformation of race." These
fat, huge, fierce, vicious, dull, ill-shaped creatures are
distinctly of a Saxon strain. In Cedric's day they
were the Gurths who herded the swine, and the "gigantic
jades" who in the very teeth of Mother Church persisted
in a merciless disciplinary "flogging of their slaves."
Suggestions of racial derivation are seldom questioned
in ordinary life. Every English thinker recognizes the
fact. The biographer of an eminent English lawyer says
that he combined, in the most pleasing fashion, fineness
of physical texture with courage, high character, and the
perfection of personal charm. The same writer thinks it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
necessary to explain that on the maternal side the gifted
lawyer "came of gentle blood." Apart from personal
characteristics, the very name of the maternal <em>gens</em> bore
witness to her Norman descent&mdash;a name that has been
familiar in Kentucky from the foundation of the State.
According to the same biographer the conditions on the
paternal side were quite different. An uncle, of the ruder
strain, declared, in view of prospective Revolutionary
tribunals, that <em>his</em> veins were "uncontaminated with one
drop of gentility." He stood among the intellectual
aristocracy of England just the same.</p>

<p>But, if the philosophic Taine is severe in his characterization
of the "carnivorous types" of the English race,
he makes ample amends in his descriptions of others.
Not every Englishman is like the landlord in Barnaby
Rudge&mdash;"half ox, half bull." "On the contrary," says
this admirable Frenchman, "when the person is a cultured
and intelligent gentleman, the phlegmatic temperament
imparts to the English personality a perfectly noble air.
I have several of them in my memory, with pale complexion,
clear blue eyes, regular features, constituting one of the
finest types of the human species. There is no excess
of cavalierism, of glittering gallantry after the style of
the French gentleman; one is conscious of a mind wholly
self-contained, a brain which can not lose its balance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
They elevate this quality of their temperament into a
virtue; according to them the chief merit of a man is
always to have a clear and cool head. They are right;
nothing is more desirable in misfortune and in danger.
This is one of their national traits." Taine's historic
ideal of this type is William Pitt. The awkwardness and
erubescent bashfulness, so often observed in English
social life, "is wholly physical," says M. Taine, "and a
peculiarity of <em>Teutonic</em> nations." It is certainly not the
fine repose that is supposed to mark the caste of Never
Care. <em>Another</em> type admired by this clever Frenchman
is thus described: "The blond maiden with downcast
eyes, purer than one of Raffaelle's Madonnas, a sort of
Eve, incapable of falling, whose voice is music, adorable
in candour, gentleness, and goodness, and before whom
one is tempted to lower the eyes out of respect. Since
Virginia, Imogen, and the other women of Shakespeare
or his great contemporaries&mdash;from these to Esther and
to the Agnes of Dickens&mdash;English literature has placed
them in the foreground; they are the perfect flower of
the land."</p>

<p>The Section of the Association at Newcastle which
listened to the paper of M. Du Chaillu with an air of courteous
self-restraint, listened also, and apparently in a like
mood, to Sir William Turner in the reading of his very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
able paper on the pathological aspect of the doctrine of
"Heredity," as recently expounded in the revolutionary
hypothesis of Professor Weismann, a famous German pundit
in pathology. It was the first appearance of the so-called
Weismann "theory" before the scientific public of England.
Professor Weismann rejects the view that the characteristics
acquired by parents through their own experiences
or environment can be transmitted to their offspring.
It is only those characteristics that have pre-existed in
the germ of reproduction: that is, the congenital peculiarities
alone; those which distinguish the race and breed
that can be transmitted, according to the teachings of
Professor Weismann. A German philosopher, for example,
may transmit a superfluous toe or a prognathic jaw, but
not his portentously developed brain. Sir William Turner
did not accept in full the German's "theory." Under
the exclusive operation of a law which transmits only
from congenital variations, how is it conceivable that the
development of species can be brought about? On the
other hand, does not the law of the survival of the fittest
operate to correct the tendency to transmit defects of
structure and organization? Thus, affirmed our sturdy
Anglo-Saxon savant, the hereditary tendency, properly
understood, is in perfect harmony with the theory of
natural selection. It is needless to say that the Section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and the speaker were quite at one upon these perplexing
points. The conclusions of Darwin upon "Descent" were
as little open to assault as their own conviction as to the
origin of the Anglo-Saxon race. At all events, an Englishman's
established opinions would not tumble at the
first blast of a ram's horn from Germany or France.</p>

<p>The discussion of the physical peculiarities of our
ancestors never loses its interest among the thinkers
of the various branches of the English race. How trippingly
upon the tongue of the Anglo-Saxon child
come the familiar lines of the English poet, a bard
of the Georgian period:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i18">"Deep-blooming, strong,<br /></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">And yellow-haired, the blue-eyed Saxon came."<br /></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>a pleasing description of peculiarities which holds
good of the Northern races to this day. But by a
process of ethnic differentiation the separate or divergent
races, with changed <i lang="fr">milieu</i> and lapse of time, took
on some structural change; the Scandinavian, for example
(and possibly the Kentuckian), coming to the front
with cranial dimensions exceptionally large and mental
capacities to correspond. Laing's curious note to
Snorro Sturleson (quoted by Lytton) says that in the
Antiquarian Museum of Copenhagen the handles of almost
all the swords of the early ages, in these collections, "indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>cate
a size of hand very much smaller than the hands of
modern people of any class or race." The Norman is said
to have retained this peculiarity of physical structure
longer than the Scandinavian from whom he sprang. It
was probably the result of social conditions which soon
ceased to exist. "Here and there," says an eminent
English writer, "amongst plain countryfolk settled from
time immemorial in the counties peopled with the
Anglo-Dane (Scandinavian), may be found the 'Scythian
hand and foot,' the high features, and the reddish auburn
hair." "But amongst the far more mixed breed,"
he adds, "of the larger landed proprietors (comprehended
in the peerage), the Saxon attributes of race are strikingly
conspicuous, and amongst them the large hand and foot
common to all of the Germanic tribes." (Lord Lytton.)
Virginia and the Virginian States were peopled chiefly
from the former class. If any inquirer wishes to prosecute
this inquiry under favorable conditions, he may find
a contemporary transmission of racial peculiarities in
the vast Scandinavian population in our Northern belt
or tier of States&mdash;men of the old blood, in a broad,
congenial field, with boundless energy and big brains.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a></h2>


<p>One of the most interesting results of a very prolonged
process of ethnic differentiation is mentioned by
John Fiske, in comparing two remote branches of the
so-called "Aryan" race&mdash;the short, fat, pursy Hindoo,
and the wiry, long-limbed Kentuckian. It is not incredible
that these were simply original marks of race&mdash;"Scythian,"
in the one instance; Scandinavian in the
other. It is a far cry, too, from old Benares to the Bluegrass;
but it is possible that if missionaries from Kentucky
could remain in Hindustan long enough there might
be a gradual reversion of the Occidental variety to the
ancient or original type. If Mr. Fiske's deductions be correct,
as possibly they are, the Aryan brothers have wandered
far apart, and perhaps it is hardly safe, in studying
the genetic conditions of development in the Bluegrass, to
stray beyond the broad, well-traveled highway that reaches
from the Baltic Sea through Normandy and the British
Isles to the shores of the Old Dominion, to the Blue Ridge
Mountains, the "Hills of Breathitt," and the Bluegrass lowlands
of Kentucky. The streams of population from the
Scandinavian seas are still flowing, and in all likelihood the
Scandinavians of the Virginian States (the old settled
populations of the States of the South and West) will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
ultimately fuse with the Scandinavian populations of
the North and establish in the heart of the continent the
empire of the world. The great Scandinavian settlements
of the Northwest are now almost equal in numbers to the
Anglo-Norman populations that from the days of the
Virgin Queen have been gathering and growing in Old
Virginia and in the Virginian sisterhood of States. Coleridge
once said that England's insular position had made
her a mother of nations. It would seem that like conditions&mdash;an
environing wilderness and an estranging sea&mdash;have
helped to make Virginia a "mother of States." The
lawless elements that poured into Kentucky were not
segregated by social or other necessities, and, cast out
by time or poverty, permanently isolated in one rude
locality. This was at one time a popular theory among
the savants. But there was always a tendency to <em>lawlessness</em>
wherever the Anglo-Norman went. If any "convict"
blood muddied the turbulent, brawling stream of
migration, it was not from the <em>race</em>, but from the chance
intermingling of a degenerate <em>caste</em> or <em>breed</em>, and whether
you find that degenerate admixture in the rugged highlands
or in the lovely champaign country at their feet,
the convict blood is still there. In the highlands or the
lowlands, in the mountains or the Bluegrass, generation
after generation is weighted with the curse. The family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the clan, the community never loses the criminal taint.
But the great, strong, daring, gifted <em>race</em> sweeps on
untouched by the vile marks of degeneracy that would
put a proud, ambitious caste to shame.</p>

<p>The trade of political assassination was plied with great
activity in the good old Norman times, but apparently
there was nothing that was beastly, or basely criminal,
in the work; on the contrary, it seems to have been palliated
almost invariably by the conditions of a traditional
feud, and, where sentiment or authority was very exacting,
the offense was sometimes justified under "the forms of
law." This was not murder in any ordinary or vulgar
sense. It was merely an indispensable <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> in
times that imperiled men's bodies as well as tried their
souls; one of those protective devices conceived by the
savagery of mediæval statecraft in a transition period of
Christian civilization. Even at this day it is difficult
for a competent and experienced Anglo-Norman jury to
detect decisive evidence of crime when looking through the
subtile meshes of a technical defense. William himself
had a strong disinclination to take life under the forms of
law; and, possibly, had his loyal guardians yielded to a
like weakness in the early days of his succession, the solid
fabric of English or Anglo-Norman civilization would now
be as unsubstantial as a castle in Spain. But they did
not share the weakness of their ward, and promptly settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the right of succession by assassinating all troublesome
pretenders to the throne. The only sin of blood upon
William's soul&mdash;"the blackest act of his life"&mdash;was the
execution of a judicial sentence against Waltheof upon
the hill of St. Giles. The only inexplicable crime of Waltheof's
life was his murder of the brothers Carl, staunch
comrades who had stood by his side at York. The judicial
murder was wrought by the orders of a <em>Norman king</em>.
It was apparently premeditated, and done with the utmost
deliberation and under established forms of law. The
Carl brothers were the victims of an ancient feud. Their
grandsire had slain the father of Waltheof, and the grandsons
of the murderer were slain to avenge this ancient
deed of blood. They were the victims of a transmitted
<em>hate</em>: of a vindictive passion that had lost its heat. But
the murderer perished at last, under the forms of law
which he had denied to the innocent victims of a feud. He
could slay with impunity on his own account, but he was
not allowed to conspire even in thought against the king.
He, too, suffered the penalty long years after the offense.
Waltheof was the last of the <em>Saxon earls</em>.</p>

<p>Not long ago that eminent publicist, Mr. Andrew D.
White, delivered an address on the subject of "High Crime
in the United States." The following excerpt will be read
with interest:</p>

<p>"Simply as a matter of fact the United States is, among
all civilized nations of the world, the country in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the crime of murder is most frequently committed and
least frequently punished. Deaths by violence are increasing
rapidly. Our record is now larger than that of any
other country in the world. The number of homicides
that are punished by lynching exceeds the number punished
by due process of law.</p>

<p>"There is too much overwrought sentimentality in
favor of the criminal. The young ward toughs look up
with admiration to local politicians who have spent a
part of their lives in State prison. Germs of maudlin
sentimentality are widespread. On every hand we hear
slimy, mushy-gushy expressions of sympathy; the criminal
called 'plucky,' 'nervy,' 'fighting against fearful odds
for his life.'</p>

<p>"It may be said that society must fall back on the law
of self-preservation. It should cut through and make
war, in my opinion, for its life. Life imprisonment is not
possible, because there is no life imprisonment.</p>

<p>"<em>In the next year nine thousand people will be murdered.</em>
As I stand here to-day, I tell you that nine thousand are
doomed to death with all the cruelty of the criminal heart,
and with no regard for home and families, and two thirds
will be due to the maudlin sentiment sometimes called
mercy. I have no sympathy for the criminal. My sympathy
is for those who will be murdered, for their families,
and for their children."</p>

<p>The Normans were a brilliant and enterprising race;
but what before all things (says Freeman) "distinguished
them from other nations, was their <em>craft</em>." This was
manifest in everything, at all times, and everywhere&mdash;in
statesmanship, in war, in traffic, and in the trivial
interactions of social and domestic life. Craft was no
more characteristic of a Norman king in the past than of
a Norman trader in modern times. It is as distinctly
racial as the commercial "cuteness" or cleverness universally
attributed to the American people of to-day. Lord
Wolseley may have noted this trait when he said of our
people, "They are a race of English-speaking Frenchmen."
He may have observed, too, even during the War between
the States, that Americans were at times exceedingly
<em>profane in their speech</em>, just as in the olden time it was
said that the Normans were "peculiarly fond of oaths."
Camden tells us that when Carolus Stultus made over
Normandy to Rollo, the rude ingrate refused to kiss the
king's foot. When urged to do so he viciously exclaimed,
"<em>Ne se, by God!</em>" "Whence"&mdash;adds the chronicler&mdash;"the
Normans were familiarly known as <em>Bigodi</em> or <em>Bigods</em>." At
every other word, he says, they swore by God. For a
like reason, at a later day, the English were known through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>out
Europe as the English "Goddams." All of us know
how terribly the army swore in Flanders. The profane tendencies
of the race seemed to have been stimulated by war.
"Then, the <span class="smcap">Soldier</span>," says Shakespeare, "full of strange
oaths." Was it not one of our innocent Bluegrass girls who
declared that up to the close of her "teens" she believed
the familiar phrase "damned Yankee" to be a <em>single</em>
word? But it was the Conqueror of England and the
founder of the Anglo-Norman race that swore the greatest
oath of all. When the merry burghers of Alençon were
hurling insults from their walls upon the burly son of
Arletta and upon her sire&mdash;the tanner of Falaise&mdash;the
infuriated Norman swore an oath which lights up the
page of history like the flare of a conflagration&mdash;"By the
splendor of God!" he exclaimed as he swept to his wild
revenge. The profanest Kentuckian in his palmiest days
never rose in his profanity to such a plane as this. He
preferred the direct and trenchant speech of that Virgin
Queen who helped to shape the destiny of our common
race. "Do as I say," she said to a recalcitrant prelate,
"or by God I will <em>unfrock</em> you!" Even her stately ministers
were not safe from the fire of her Anglo-Norman wrath.
In the royal council-chamber she sometimes fell to cursing
like a very drab. In certain Virginian circles profane
swearing seemed to have been proscribed except in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
softened or attenuated form, such as "Jeems' River,"
as an ejaculatory substitute for a very blasphemous
phrase. Thomas Jefferson did not regard profane "expletives"
as a very rational or philosophic mode of speech;
but George Washington, though puritanically truthful,
would sometimes infuse into an imprecation the spirit and
effectiveness of a prayer. We have all heard of Stonewall
Jackson's "teamster" and the moving quality of his profane
speech; but Jubal Early never allowed the words to be
taken out of his mouth in this way. He did his own swearing,
and, presumably, did it well. Swearing or fighting by
proxy was not his forte. Judged by military results, Jackson's
was probably the better method. As a tactical incentive
upon the firing line nothing could be more effective
than one of Early's oaths; but for general strategic purposes,
nothing could surpass the effectiveness of the deadly
imprecations that lurked in Stonewall Jackson's prayer.
This was a Cromwellian modification of the Anglo-Norman
oath. In the good old Commonwealth of Kentucky there
seems to have been a relapse into the simpler forms of
profanity&mdash;Anglo-Norman and Early English. The historian
Collins tells us that one of the pioneer Governors having
refused to notice the "challenge" of a truculent upstart,
the fellow threatened to "post him a coward." "Post
and be damned," said the old soldier, "you will only post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
yourself a damned liar!" The retort was profane, but it
was in punctilious accord with the spirit and habits of the
time. Better still, it was more effective than a "gut-shot"
at short range. As a rule, the Kentuckian had an instinctive
aversion for puritanic oaths. That consecrated phrase,
"Jeems' River," had a brief career in this State. The
last person to use it, probably, was an elderly, smooth,
genial, charming gentleman at the bar who was for many
years the judge of a local court in the good old County of
Fleming. He was in many respects a marked exception
to the common rule.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It might have been different had
he left the Old Dominion at an earlier date. What brandy
is for heroes, strong oaths were for the pioneer. Not mere
dicer's oaths; nor the mauldin imprecations of a sot, nor
the rounding touches of a raconteur; but good, honest,
English oaths, such an oath as that which settled the
insistent Corporal Trim&mdash;the generous and daring oath
that our Uncle Toby swore when the young Lieutenant
lay sick of a fever. "'He shall not die, by God,' cried
my Uncle Toby." And the accusing spirit that "flew to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Heaven's chancery with the oath" had the grace to blush
when he gave it in. God bless our Uncle Toby; he was
the Uncle Toby of us all, and is as fresh in our remembrance
as the good old uncles who told his story and praised
his virtues and swore his oaths by the family fireside in the
auld lang syne. Tradition throws a strong light on one
of these old Kentuckians who denounced with suggestive
picturesqueness of phrase a ruthless master who had sold
and separated a family of hereditary slaves:&mdash;"He is the
damnedest scoundrel between hell and Guinea!" the old
gentleman exclaimed, giving in effect a touch of lurid or
local color to his imprecatory speech. But when one of
his own negroes&mdash;a broken, helpless creature&mdash;was accused
of marketing for his own benefit the products of the farm,
he gently answered, "Ah, well, I am not sure that, after
all, the old slave is not <em>taking his own</em>!" As one recalls
that kindly speech, with its reminiscent touch of Uncle
Toby, he recalls, likewise, the sentiment of a famous line
from a foreign source tenderly adapted to a modern
taste&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the most popular of the well-trained African
servitors of the mid-century days in the Bluegrass was
our versatile drudge, Ben Briler, one of the most active
and useful functionaries of that old-time tavern life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="i0">"Ben Briler swept the poker-room&mdash;<br /></span></div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Evil days came to Ben's master, and Ben was sold&mdash;becoming
the joint chattel of the young swells of the
poker-room. But the joint chattel proved to be too
versatile for his vocation, and one of the stockholders
denounced him as "a damned kinky-headed <em>corporation</em>,"
<em>and kicked him downstairs</em>. As Governor Desha, in a recent
message to the Legislature, had effectively arraigned
those "dangerous corporations which embodied the interests
of powerful men," the prompt action of the stockholder
at the old tavern brought great relief to the public mind.
It showed that corporations could be <em>reached</em>&mdash;that, contrary
to the general impression, they had "bodies that
could be kicked and souls that could be damned."</p>

<p>The advent of the abolition "emissary," the emancipated
negro, and the "burnt cork" minstrel was prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>tically
contemporaneous in Kentucky. In the gentle
mid-century days a company of strolling minstrels had
announced an entertainment at the old county seat of
Mason&mdash;the town where Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe (a
frequent guest of Mrs. Marshall Key) first witnessed a
"sale" of negro slaves. On the evening announced for
the entertainment, the Courthouse was packed from floor
to dome. Among the conspicuous figures toward the
front was Colonel Robert B., a fine old Kentuckian of antique
Norman type&mdash;tall, ruddy, high-featured, light haired;
hearty, convivial, and profane&mdash;a boon companion and
<i lang="fr">bon vivant</i>. He sat expectantly but at ease, a bandaged
arm resting upon the seat in front. He was cordially
greeted by kinsmen and friends in every part of the house.
The curtain rose and the minstrels filed upon the stage,
looking for all the world like a lot of "free nigger" swells.
Their very appearance was an offense, and provoked at
once a collision with the young Mohawks of the town.
The violoncello was shivered into splinters, and the flutes,
fiddles, and castanets went singing through the air. No
trace of harmony was left. There was a universal dash
for windows and doors; none stood upon the order of his
going. All went at once&mdash;all except "Colonel Bob," who
sat unmoved, fixed to his seat as if fascinated by the moving
scene in front. The spectators were amazed. "Hell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
fire, Bob!" exclaimed an anxious friend, "don't you know
there is a <em>fight</em> going on down there?" The Colonel looked
incredulous. "I wish I may be damned," he said, "if I
didn't think it was <em>part of the play</em>!" There was universal
condemnation of these minstrel folk by persons who did
not see the show; but the Colonel, who was a "stayer,"
insisted that "the niggers made a good fight."</p>

<p>Unquestionably there is a certain lack of modernity,
or at least of civilized amenity, in such a manifestation as
this: but there was a spontaneous and elemental vivacity
in their unpremeditated assault upon the counterfeit African
bucks which betrayed the rude fantastic humor of their
Norman blood, and imparted a pleasant tang to the crude
flavor of early plantation life. Mr. Barrett Wendell finds
in the still earlier life of the West conditions described as
existing in the times of the Plantagenet kings; and Mr.
Owen Wister seems inclined to adopt his startling views.
Apparently, then, we must count with inherited conditions
and characteristics even in the politics of the times. The
modern world is probably not ideally moral, but it is
sensitively fastidious and scrupulously observant of "good
form." It would wreck a railway, perhaps, or deplete a
bloated insurance exchequer, but it would not launch an
ungentlemanly imprecation or utter a trivial or unproductive
oath. It even discountenances the <em>oath in court</em>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a solemn asseveration or attestation before a judge. It
utterly discredits&mdash;socially and otherwise&mdash;the blas-<em>phe</em>-mous
ejaculation or the vulgar "cuss-word," or the light
conversational "swear" familiar in the dialect of the
"back shop," the groggery, and the street. The variety
of oath known as a "swear," considered psychologically,
is not a very serious offense. In a philosophical
aspect, indeed, it is in some sense a temperamental
necessity, dependent on physiological conditions, and is
essentially the result of a defensive or protective instinct.
Where not merely idle, wanton, and unmeaning, it is a
psychological <i lang="la">regulator nervorum</i>. It is the unpremeditated
product of a prompt cerebral reaction. It gives the
centers of speech a chance to rally when thrown into disorder
by a sudden attack. There is no time for the picking
and arranging of words, and, except in persons of
lymphatic temperament, no capacity for the leisurely
elaborations of speech. One is confronted, not with a
problem, or theory or condition, but with an <em>emergency</em>
that must be decisively met. Silence perhaps is golden,
but there is a certain steel-like quality in trenchant speech.
Profane, "rapid-fire" ejaculation is not only a deeply
implanted instinct, but by frequent indulgence becomes
an invincible habit&mdash;a habit so odious and offensive as
to make even a Chesterfield swear. As a racial instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it survives transplantation to any clime, and religious
training of every sort. Even the disciplinary methods of
Calvinism fail to eradicate it. But an "inherited drill"
may at times soften, or modify, or mask the <em>mode</em> of <em>manifestation</em>,
as is cleverly illustrated in the familiar lines&mdash;</p>

exclaimed: "Does a <em>Puritan</em> drink?" "I would not give
a damn," was the decisive answer, "for a Puritan that
could not drink, pray, and fight." It is probably no secret
that in our amphibious Scandinavian, General William
Nelson, the swearing instinct was abnormally developed.
He did not swear "like a sailor," to be sure; nor "like
a trooper" of the olden time; since neither soldier nor
sailor of the ordinary type was ever gifted with his extraordinary
abundance and facility of profane expression. It
is but just to say, however, that at times he struggled manfully
against the habitual inclination. "Christ give me
patience!" he cried when his favorite aide, Colonel Samuel
Owens (a joker of the Norman type), inadvertently "sat
down" upon his military hat. The utterance was a sincere
and reverent appeal for Divine help. He instinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>tively
shrank from the coming torrent of profane ejaculation,
and with a prayerful effort was bracing himself
against the flood.</p>

<p>"There is some soul of goodness in things evil"; but
in this instance one does not lessen the force of the evil
by modifying or "softening" the form of the oath. The
essence remains unchanged. When Pecksniff slams
the door in a rage, he simply "swears" what Hood
describes as a "wooden damn." The devout Moslem will
not tread upon a scrap of paper in his path, "Lest,"
he says, "the name of God be written upon it"; but
the impetuous Anglo-Norman recklessly flings the name
of God into the contaminated environment of his
daily life. And he has done so, history attests, since
the day he sprang full-armed upon the planetary sphere&mdash;the
most portentous apparition of mediæval days. "Long
ago," says Canon Bardsley, "under the offensive title of
<em>Jean Gotdam</em>, we [the English] had become known as a
people given to strange and unpleasant oaths." The very
name&mdash;<em>Jean Gotdam</em>&mdash;vouches for its antiquity, as well
as for the fearless sincerity of him who swore.</p>

<p>There came into one of our Bluegrass communities
just after the war a clever Confederate adventurer, who
speedily established very pleasant social relations by
exploiting his military record. A venerable Kentuckian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
who had come through the war with his Confederate
principles and Virginian prejudices intact, was asked by
a friend how he liked their Virginian visitor&mdash;the ci-devant
"aide to General Lee." "I don't <em>like</em> him, sir," he said
with vicious emphasis, "he is not what he professes to be;
I never in my life heard a Virginian gentleman say 'God
<em>dern</em>!' He either swore or he <em>didn't</em> swear." He had no
indulgence for a marked card nor for an emasculated
oath. He would not substitute a sickly, modernized
variant for a venerated traditional form. By "Gad"
or by "gosh" or by "gobbs" was good enough for a
reforming purist; for himself he preferred to say, with the
irascible Robert of Normandy, "Ne se, by God!" It is
not the form, after all, but the sentiment or suggestion,
that lies behind the "swear."</p>

<p>It is discouraging to the spirit of philosophic optimism
to note the slinking figure of the iconoclast now running
amuck in every field. The instinct and habit of
reverence is almost gone, and the solidest traditional
reputations are no longer safe. We no longer say with
Wallenstein&mdash;</p>

<p>Even the fine historic character of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> is
"at a discount" in the modern world&mdash;partly on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of his alleged indulgence in profane speech, but chiefly
because of his recognized incapacity to tell a lie. He had
not only lost (we are told by one biographer) the useful&mdash;the
indispensable&mdash;instinct of "prevarication," but (as
we are told by another) "when deeply angered, he would
<em>swear a hearty English oath</em>." One may survive in the
Darwinian struggle without the capacity to <em>swear</em>, but
scarcely without the capacity to deceive. There seems to
be no salvation in this life except for the successful liar;
but for the man of many oaths there appears to be no
salvation either in this life or the next. Happily, the
material prosperity of Virginia was but little affected by
the ethics of the Washingtonian Code. Her commercial
instincts had been powerfully quickened in her early
years by an admonitory imprecation from a royal, or
official, source. When the Commissioners of Virginia were
pleading the interests of "learning and religion" before
the Attorney-General of Charles II (an Anglo-Norman
lawyer, no doubt), he promptly responded with a hearty
English oath&mdash;"Damn your souls! <em>Grow tobacco!</em>" There
is no need for such an adjuration to the planters of the
fine old Anglo-Norman Commonwealth of Kentucky.
The tobacco will be planted, whatever may become of
their souls.</p>

<p>An English scholar of sound judgment and exceptionally
sound views has recently said that the Emperor Napoleon
was the greatest administrator of all time. His greatest
work, perhaps, is the system of administrative centralization
which, through a century of the severest tests that
political madness could apply, has maintained the conditions
of social order even in the midst of war and under
every form of organized misrule, and secured almost
unparalleled prosperity for the municipalities and provinces
of France. But it must not be forgotten that William
the Norman solved a like problem with apparently even
greater success, and under antagonizing conditions which
only a statesman of original genius could successfully confront.
Not for one century, only, of marvelous effectiveness
in civic administration, but for eight hundred years
of advancing and expanding <em>civilization</em>, the conceptions
evolved by the Norman's brain have been doing their
beneficent work; and great as was the genius of the Corsican
adventurer, it is not incredible that even he, the master
of Europe, did not disdain the lesson which had been taught
the nations by that magnificent Son of France. The Corsican
was a close student of military history, and secretly
meditated a descent upon modern England in imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the earlier Conqueror's work. It is not likely that he
would overlook the methods of reorganization that followed
the war, with its machinery of sheriffs, judges,
justiciaries, etc.&mdash;executive officers directly responsible
to the king&mdash;bringing the throne in direct touch with the
people, and drawing every subject, at least in every central
shire, in direct personal allegiance to the throne.
The <em>Marquessess</em>, or wardens of the Marches, were able
and ambitious warriors whose sole concern was with dangers
from <em>without</em>. But even Napoleon could not foresee,
in this guarded initiatory recognition of the landowner,
the ultimate evolution of a territorial democracy that
was to affect the political and social destinies of the English
race. Monarchs of a later date&mdash;Henry the Eighth
and his masterful daughter Elizabeth&mdash;saw in the people
the sole source of <em>power</em>; and the loyal Englishman even
of this generation will proudly tell you that in his country
the sole fountain of <em>honor</em> is the <em>king</em>. There were at
least two American statesmen who were illustrious disciples
of the Norman's political school. They were men of Norman
blood, who wrought in American statecraft with the
Norman's constructive brain&mdash;and there was still another
of the same imperial strain who, with a philosophic conception
of all that was of value in the principles of Anglo-Norman
administration and a just appreciation by actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
experience of government as a practical art, never failed
throughout a long, brilliant, and successful career to teach
the doctrine that the <em>People Themselves</em> were the sole
fountain of honor and the exclusive source of power&mdash;a
principle in the philosophy of government and in political
administration equally patent to William the Conqueror,
when he anxiously sought a declaration of "personal"
allegiance <em>from the subjects</em> in that great gathering of
potential "sovereigns" upon Salisbury Plain. In the long
succession of administrators that followed the Norman
king, there was none that seems to have grasped so completely
and applied so skillfully his principles and methods
of political administration as a daughter of the Tudor race.
She may not have loved the people in any modern sense;
but she knew their power, she recognized their rights;
she studied their interests, and her jeweled finger was
always upon their pulse. The best of all treatment, she
thought, was to anticipate with soothing remedies the rude
distempers of the times. She considered rather the Constitution
of the Subject than the Constitution of the State;
since, collectively, one embraced the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett Wendell, in his admirable work, "A Literary
History of America," discourses with great brilliancy and
charm upon the Elizabethan influences that governed in
a large measure the development of the Puritan and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Virginian race. The reader of the present paper will note
with curious interest the bearing of the following quotations
from this work upon the theories which the present
writer has discussed. "Broadly speaking," he says, "all
our Northern colonies were developed from those planted
in Massachusetts; and all our Southern from that planted
in Virginia." The statement is "socially" true, he says,
to an extraordinary degree. The Elizabethan type of
character "displayed a marked power of <em>assimilating</em> whatever
came within its influence." This trait, akin to that
which centuries before had made the conquered English
slowly but surely <em>assimilate their Norman conquerors</em>, the
Yankees of our own day have not quite lost. Our native
type still "absorbs" the foreign. The children of immigrants
insensibly become native. The irresistible power
of a <em>common language</em> and of the <em>common ideals</em> which underlie
it still dominates. This tendency, he adds, declared
itself from the earliest settlements of Jamestown and
Plymouth. "North and South alike may be regarded
as regions finally settled by Elizabethan Englishmen."
The dominant traits of the English race of that time were
"spontaneity, enthusiasm, and versatility." But the Elizabethan
English of <em>Virginia</em>, he says, were notably different
in this: they were men of a less "austere" type of character
than their compatriots of the North; of more adven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>turous
"instincts," and were "men of action" as the
New Englanders were "men of God." The peculiar
power of assimilation and the "pristine alertness of mind"
were the same in both. The economic superiority of the
North was manifest; the political ability of the South
seemed generally superior. Pleasantly putting aside the
traditional claims of exclusive "cavalier" descent, Mr.
Wendell says: "At least up to the Civil War the personal
temper of the better classes in the South remained more
like that of the better classes in Seventeenth Century
England than anything else in the modern world." He
frankly concedes that the most eminent statesmen of
Colonial and Revolutionary days were Virginians. Recalling
what has been said in regard to the constitutional
sluggishness of the Anglo-Saxon, his mental inertness, his
settled or stereotyped habits of thought, and his absolute
lack of racial initiative <em>until the Norman came</em>, we read
the following passage from Mr. Wendell with curious interest:
"Such literature as the English world has left us
bespeaks a public whose spontaneous alertness of mind,
whose instant perception of every subtle variety of phrase
and allusion, was more akin to that of our <em>contemporary
French</em> than to anything which we are now accustomed
to consider native to insular England." This transformation
Mr. Wendell attributes to "the spontaneous, enthusias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tic
versatility of the English temperament," in the spacious
Elizabethan days. What has produced or determined
this extraordinary differentiation of race? What are the
original, genetic factors behind this varied manifestation
of power in that old, Elizabethan stock? With the
advent of the Seventeenth Century; with the turbulence,
and trouble, and austerity of Cromwellian days; with migrations
following Cromwellian war; with the evolution of
a transatlantic type of the English race, there came an
end to those spacious and splendid days&mdash;to the creative,
prolific epoch of the Virgin Queen.</p>

<p>The most trivial fact that connects the name of Shakespeare
with Virginia is of interest to the Virginian and his
multitudinous clans. Captain Newport, Vice-Admiral of
Virginia, commanded the ship <em>Sea Adventure</em>, which was
wrecked on the Devil's Islands. Sir George Somers, sitting
on the poop and misled by a flaming apparition on the
masts, unconsciously guided the vessel in a fatal course.
William Strachey, "Secretary in Virginia," wrote the account
of the "Tempest" published in Purchas. Thus was
the "king's ship" boarded and burned by the spirit Ariel
at the command of his master Prospero, and wrecked on
those "Bermoothes" which are "still vext" by that rude,
tempestuous sea. It is of interest, too, to note that the
special Supervisors and Directors of this Elizabethan colony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
were William Shakespeare's friends&mdash;the Earl of Southampton;
the Earl of Pembroke; the Earl of Montgomery;
Viscount Lisle (brother of Sir Philip Sidney); Lord Howard
of Walden; Lord Sheffield; and Lord Carew of Clopton,
who sold Shakespeare, in 1597, the house in which he
lived till 1616&mdash;all of them Elizabethan cavaliers derived
from Anglo-Norman stock. There is another Elizabethan
name of still greater interest to all people of the Anglo-Virginian
race&mdash;Sir Edwin Sandys, the author of the
political charters upon which the free institutions of
Virginia rest; and not only Virginia, but the United States.
Educated at Geneva and the son of an English Archbishop,
he was thoroughly seasoned with the doctrines of the
Genevan school; and aimed not only to found the American
Republic on Genevan lines by the creation of a "free state"
on the Atlantic coast, but to make ample provision <em>in
the charter itself</em> for the ultimate "expansion" of the young
republic toward the Pacific Ocean. This statement may
not, even yet, be universally accepted; but it is incontestably
true.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a></h2>


<p>In the spring of 1885, a pamphlet was published by a
citizen of Kentucky directing attention to the effect of
certain racial influences in molding the institutions of
this State. It was entitled "The Genesis of a Pioneer
Commonwealth." The suggestions offered by the writer
as to the sources of our organic life were subsequently
illustrated and confirmed by an eminent Virginian scholar,
Dr. Alexander Brown, in his "Genesis of the United States,"
published in 1890&mdash;a marvel of masterly investigation; a
work which throws a flood of light upon the broad expanse
of early American history, and is especially remarkable for
the critical elaboration, lucidity, and acuteness with which
the author has arranged the results of his extensive scheme
of historic research. In this work he has noted and traced,
from English records contemporary with the first settlement
of Virginia, the beginnings of that great duel between
conflicting civilizations which closed with the destruction
of Spain's naval power at Manila and Santiago. And
every scholar who seeks a precise comprehension of the
<em>origines</em> of the late war should closely follow the course of
investigation pursued by Dr. Brown. Every accessible
detail of the desperate and protracted Anglo-Spanish conflict&mdash;including
the exploits of Elizabeth's captains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the destruction of the Great Armada&mdash;come out under
this historic searchlight as distinctly and vividly as material
objects under the light of day. To citizens of Kentucky
who have a critical and philosophic interest in
the historic evolution of the Commonwealth, it will be
peculiarly attractive in the circumstance that it connects,
and in a special sense includes, the Genesis of
Kentucky with that of the United States. He suggests
in a most interesting way that this Commonwealth is
not only a lineal product of the Elizabethan civilization
which he has sought to trace, but that&mdash;cartographically
at least&mdash;<em>it formed an integral part of the first Republic
established in the New World</em>. In an explanatory communication
addressed some years ago to the present
writer, Dr. Brown says: "The bounds of the charters
which contained the <em>popular charter rights</em> which were the
germ of this republic extended between thirty-four degrees
(34°) and forty degrees (40°) north latitude, and from
ocean to ocean. Kentucky, therefore, was embraced
within the first Republic in America."</p>

<p>The sagacious statesmen of Spain were not slow to
detect the menacing significance of this Virginian settlement,
small as it was; and the conflict then initiated did
not cease until the navies of Spain went down under the
guns of Dewey and Schley. The persistent machinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of Spanish <i lang="fr">intrigants</i> to obtain control of Kentucky in
the closing years of the Eighteenth Century were part of
the same prolonged contest for supremacy upon American
soil. Every resource of diplomacy, intrigue, and corruption&mdash;or,
in modern phrase, of <em>craft</em> and <em>graft</em>&mdash;was exhausted
by Spain to wrest the germinant Commonwealth from
the parent stem. On the other hand, no scheme was more
popular with the bold and enterprising Kentuckians&mdash;the
Vikings of the West&mdash;than to wrest the control of the
Mississippi River from the desperate grasp of Spain.
Even the splendid and seducing allurement of a Spanish
alliance was powerless against the transmitted
instincts of a Scandinavian or Anglo-Norman stock. But
the racial inclination for territorial expansion Kentucky
never lost. There was a later manifestation of this spirit
or instinct in the annexation of California; an appropriation
by force, to be sure, but under recognized "legal
forms"; and, still later, it was manifested in disastrous
expeditions to the Cuban coast, in which the reckless
survivors barely escaped, like the man of Uz, with the skin
of their teeth&mdash;thanks to a swift steamship and to an
indulgent interpretation of the violated law. In the near
future, perhaps, we shall have an annexation of the Island
under forms which will fully justify the act; annexation
on the old lines. As far as race could make them so, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
daring adventurers who poured to foreign war from the
vast network of streams and streamlets that flowed seaward
from the mountains and lowlands of Kentucky were
<em>Vikings</em>, with all the fighting characteristics of that
ancient breed.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Not <em>Vi</em>-Kings, nor "kings" of any sort,
but simply the Vik-ings or "Creek-men" who followed their
expatriated Jarls wherever a dragon-prow would float; to
the land of the Saxon under his greatest king; to the heart
of Ireland, where the natives were already "absorbing"
the alien Norse; to the ancient Kingdom of Gaul; to
Scotland and to the islands of the Atlantic Ridge; and
above all to Iceland, the land of mist and snow and fire;
to the incomparable mistress of the Northern seas.
Through the beautiful Mediterranean, too, they sailed;
and gathering to the support of the decadent despotisms
of the East, became famous in history and romance as
the <em>Varangian</em> Guard which held at bay the Saracen and
the Hun. They were "rebels" when they fled from the
consolidating despotism of Harold Fairhair. They have
been rulers or rebels ever since.</p>

<p>But the story of their greatest exploits you read in the
histories of the English race. We have analyzed the claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which Mr. Barrett Wendell has made for the Elizabethan
settler upon the Atlantic Coast; and it is instructive to
note that another gifted son of New England, Mr. John
Fiske, has reached conclusions which he at least would
acknowledge give confirmation to the present views, as
strong as proof of Holy Writ. "The descendants of these
Northmen," he says, "formed a very large proportion of
the population of the East Anglian counties, and consequently
of the men who founded New England. The
East Anglian counties have been conspicuous for resistance
to tyranny and for freedom of thought." By parity of
reasoning, we may easily prove that the kindred Norman
was the founder of civilization in England, and, in direct
sequence and by filiation of race, of civilization in the
Colony of Virginia; and, by a gradual evolution, in the
States of the South and West.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Far back in the history of our race there stands, luminous
and large, in his <i lang="fr">milieu</i> of mediæval mist, a mounted
conqueror with sword and torch&mdash;the immediate offspring
of Scandinavian Jarls&mdash;the remote progenitor of the
Virginian "Cavalier." It is the founder of that Anglo-Norman
civilization of which we form a part, and
which, in many ways, still responds to the impulse of
that imperial brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>William the Norman presented in vivid epitome the
characteristic traits of his race, with other traits or variations
of these traits that made him almost an abnormal
figure even in the history of those times. He has been
commonly depicted as physically a giant among his fellows;
but Lord Lytton (a good authority) discredits these legends
of gigantic stature; it is seldom we find, he declares, the
association of great size and commanding intellect in great
men; it is really a violation of the natural law, though
possibly the great Norman may have been, like Abraham
Lincoln, an exception to the general rule. His physical
forces were certainly subjected to severe tests. His personal
leadership in the wintry marches through the North
of England were, practically, paralleled in later days by
the wintry marches of our Scandinavian general, George
Rogers Clark, in the vast territories of the North and West.
The prodigious fortitude and endurance manifested in
these campaigns proved beyond all question the staying
capacity of the Scandinavian blood. The royal Norman
had all the tastes of a forest-born man; not a mere taste
for the sports of the field as known to the English gentlemen
of a later period, but a wild, almost demoniac passion
for the atrocities of the chase as practised by the early
Norman kings. A love of royal sport does not discredit
a modern ruler of men; but scarcely such sport as this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
The "wild king," says an old English chronicler, "loves
wild beasts as if he were a wild beast himself and the
father of wild beasts." Churches and manors were swept
away to create forests and dens and retreats for the creatures
he loved to slay. He ruled, conquered, hunted, ravaged,
"harried," and subjugated from Brittany to Scotland;
and yet, says the same old chronicler in his "Flowers
of History," "he was such a lover of peace that a girl
laden with gold might traverse the whole of England
without harm."</p>

<p>As the Conqueror stood among the sovereigns of that
day, so stood the Normans among the contemporary races.
They were of peculiar type, these men&mdash;both sovereign
and subject&mdash;and were cast in a like mold. They had
body, sap, color, concentrated vigor, and inbred Thracian
fire. They had a sort of racial distinction which in its
merely personal aspects was never lost. Mingling with all
races, they yet stood in a sense separate and apart from
all. They were as the <em>Haut Brion</em> among the wines of
the Bordelais. But, unlike their native vine, they bore
transplantation to any land, and drew perpetual vigor
from every soil. Strange as it may seem, there is a confessed
incapacity for colonization in the Frenchman of to-day,
and stranger still is the remedy for this defect which some
of their leading thinkers have proposed, to wit, that the
Frenchman should transmogrify himself <em>into an Anglo-Saxon</em>.
Certainly a grotesque transformation, if effected
in the manner proposed by those pessimistic prophets
Demolins and Lemaître. France (they say) must have
colonial expansion! The Anglo-Saxon is the only successful
expansionist; we must <em>Anglo-Saxonize</em> France! They
forget that the Anglo-Saxon himself is indebted for his
success as a colonist and trader to the Scandinavian French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>men
who colonized England under William the Conqueror,
and that it was not until the Norman's demoniac spirit
of "enterprise" took possession of the Anglo-Saxon thegns
and ceorls that they even felt the impulse to "go down
to the sea in ships." Later, too, they should remember,
there was an <em>industrial</em> colonization of England by the
Frenchmen who were relentlessly expatriated in the days
of the dragonades. What France then lost has never
been fully regained. When she lost the Norman element
in its early Scandinavian form, her capacity for colonial
expansion was seriously impaired. When she colonized
England by an indiscriminate exclusion of the Huguenots
from her own soil, her capacity for normal evolution was
lost. The recanting or subjugated element that remained
is probably represented by the prescriptive "free-thinking"
anti-clerical element of to-day. The profane spirit of the
English "Bigod" had been imported into the religion of
France, and "bigotry" may discredit the claims of the
noblest faith. The extreme reactionary result in this instance
is an intolerant <em>unbelief</em>, passing at times into a
ferocious contempt for country, constitutions, and creeds.</p>

<p>The storms of Norman conquest seemed scarce to touch
the depths of Anglo-Saxon life. No marked change in
the methods of local administration accompanied the
change of kings. The rude strength of the old manorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
system was proof against radical change. Far less complex
than the centralized administration of modern France,
it was even better calculated to accommodate itself to the
changes wrought by the hand of war. Built low and strong,
it stood four-square to every shock and blast. It was
only the high towers that toppled in the sweep of the
storm. When it passed, the village-group, the manorial
life, and the rude strong sons of the soil were still there.
Andrews, an authority upon early Anglo-Saxon life, gives
us a picture of the "yeoman" which leaves much to be
desired in the way of picturesqueness and charm. Upon
the testimony of priests and leeches he is depicted as a
swinish, servile sort of creature&mdash;gross, stupid, sensual,
superstitious, cruel, and even "beastly"; with no conception
whatever of "freedom," and only the most bestial
conceptions of life. The routine of husbandry after the
Conquest knew no change. A Norman baron unseats
the Saxon thegn, but the villein and ceorl take up the
labors of the old manorial life; the new lord receives
the customary dues, and protection against lawlessness
is extended to bond and free. This servile Saxon class
were the descendants of a soldier race which many
years before the advent of the conquering Norman had
rudely dispossessed the ancient inhabitants of the soil,
and were themselves first to "harry," no doubt (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
<em>harry</em> is an old Saxon word imported from the North),
the <em>whole</em> of that turbulent realm which William harried
only in part. But the Norman harried well. It may be
said that Northumbria never rallied from the devastation
until the magical agencies of modern industrialism came
to repair the ravage that he had wrought. But elsewhere
the "Conquest" worked no such change. The Norman
simply gave completeness, variety, elevation, splendor, and
finish to the Saxon's rude but solid work. The transformation
wrought through the genius of the soldier-statesman
was not the plodding reconstruction of a shattered kingdom
upon ancient lines, but the orderly evolution of a new
and splendid civilization within conditions "visualized"
by the Conqueror's creative brain. The primordial and
paramount condition of this work was the permanent
establishment of English <em>unity</em> at the gathering of the
people upon Salisbury Plain. When the people rallied
in loyal allegiance to the throne, the old conceptions of
"feudalism" ceased to exist&mdash;vanishing centuries before
Cervantes smiled Spain's "chivalry" away. In our own
Websterian phrase, England was henceforth "one and indivisible."
The fusion of warring elements was now as
complete as if welded together by the hammer of Thor.
The consequences of that initial step are told in the
history of the English race&mdash;consequences which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
imperial statesman alone had the genius to forecast. To
no mere man does the line of the Nineteenth Century

<p>This Norman adventurer who had now practically
established all his pretensions&mdash;legitimate and illegitimate&mdash;was
destined to establish, also, a line of Anglo-Norman
princes who showed in varied ways that transmitted blood
would tell. Shakespeare, in his splendid series of historical
plays, has painted in vivid colors and fine dramatic
sequence the manifestation of this Anglo-Norman influence
through a succession of closely connected reigns&mdash;weaving
into brilliant and picturesque history the fireside traditions
which fascinated his youthful mind. The story that he
tells is unique, not only in the literature of the race, but
in the literature of man. "The only history that I know,"
said an English statesman discussing the annals of his
race, "is the history that Shakespeare wrote." No formal
historic writer has presented so faithfully or effectively
the characteristic traits and temper of that time. It is
a philosophic study, resting chiefly upon a traditional
basis, and cast in a powerful dramatic form. And who so
fit as Shakespeare to depict the features of a royal race?
This strong portrayal of their salient or their subtler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
qualities, in statecraft or in war, is something quite beyond
the reach of a mere historian's art. Through all this
dramatic movement we note the wild tricks of an hereditary
blood; the troublous or turbulent play of passions
flowing from an alien source. It is in this record alone
we find that magical touch, that moving speech, that
strange, pathetic eloquence which flows from royal lips
inspired to utterance by the sorrows of an Anglo-Norman
brain. Doubtless it is Shakespeare's noblest work. It is
certainly a product of the same imperial spirit that
breathes in the aspirations, the utterances, and the acts of
the "melancholy Dane."</p>

<p>Recent researches among the Scandinavian population
of the Northern States seem to show marked psychological
distinctions in the several branches of the Scandinavian
stock, denoting original differences in the mental make-up
and manifestations of the Norwegian, the Swede, and the
Dane; brainy races all, but the psychological manifestations
of their daily life differing in each. The Swede and his
Norwegian brother have a strong, instinctive inclination
for the ruder activities of their social environment&mdash;building,
boating, agriculture, railway construction, commercial
operations, etc.; the Dane, on the contrary, manifesting
an equally marked predilection for life in its contemplative
or æsthetic aspects&mdash;for philosophy, the <i lang="fr">belles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>lettres</i>,
the fine arts, and the higher lines of scholastic
research. His physiognomy is differentiated, so to speak,
by "the pale cast of thought." Is it not possible that
this deep intra-racial distinction was recognized by the
creator of the "melancholy Dane"?</p>

<p>But "Hamlet" was not altogether a product of Shakesperean
imagination. The original lines of the character
seem to have been found in the personality of a contemporary
thinker, himself, like Hamlet, an obstinate questioner
of invisible things. In those eager Elizabethan
times when Drake and Raleigh were "discovering" other
worlds and Shakespeare imagining new, there lived near
the ancient city of Bordeaux a modest country gentleman&mdash;a
grand seigneur of peculiar distinction&mdash;who on his
father's side was of direct English descent. He bore a
patrician title; he was lord of a rich domain, and enjoyed
social and civic distinctions of the highest sort. His
scholarship was ample and unique; his social pretensions
were not in excess of his rank; and he bore his weight of
learning "lightly like a flower." Rank, riches, scholarship,
distinction&mdash;all these he had, and <em>more</em>; he had the
prodigious gift of <em>common sense</em>, with a sort of cynical
humor flashing through an habitual mood of philosophic
thought that gave to his writing&mdash;and notably to his book
of observations and reflections&mdash;a peculiar archaic charm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
One could not pay a higher tribute to his literary power
than to add, that his writings had a powerful fascination
for Shakespeare himself. These philosophic essays supplied
the great dramatist with many subtle and striking
thoughts, and the very personality of the modest country
gentleman made a profound impression upon Shakespeare's
mind; so marked an impression indeed that according to
the affirmation or suggestion of an ingenious modern
scholar, the great English writer&mdash;himself of Anglo-Norman
blood&mdash;found in this Anglo-French philosopher the original
of that incomparable dramatic figure&mdash;the "melancholy
<span class="smcap">Dane</span>." If this theory be correct, it simply adds to the
evidence of a certain bizarre weirdness in the working of
that old Scandinavian blood. Be this as it may, if the
mind of Shakespeare could be touched and inspired by
the philosophic reflexions of a provincial thinker in France
(a Frenchman with a strong suspicion of Anglo-Norman
blood), there are doubtless others (some with the same
ethnic affinities) that may profitably be reached in the
same way; and lest the Anglo-Normans of our Bluegrass
"Arcady" should take themselves too seriously, as even
the wisest may do, in the momentous matter of "family,"
"rank," "blood," and "race," it would be well at parting
to introduce for their consideration the antiquated opinions
of the same ingenious Frenchman, who, wise as he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
did not always perhaps take matters <em>seriously enough</em>.
In this instance no doubt his views will carry weight.</p>

<p>Thus much by way of preface and apology (if there be
need of either) in closing an excursive dissertation upon the
ethnological theories of Monsieur Paul Du Chaillu, accompanied
with some interesting reflections from the pen of
another Frenchman who, though not "modern" in the
same sense, seems to have been in some of his conceptions
quite judicious and even elevated in his views. This
quaint, genial, and sagacious philosopher&mdash;the author of a
famous book of "Essays"&mdash;was the Seigneur de la Montaigne,
Count of Perigord and sometime Mayor of Bordeaux,
whose greatest title to fame is this&mdash;that he was
the favorite author of William Shakespeare, the foremost
writer of all time. Possibly Montaigne by contribution
of thought was an unconscious collaborator in the construction
of "Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark," a drama
which illustrates in brilliant, powerful, and fantastic
fashion the varied intellectual and emotive capacities of
the Scandinavian blood. In that royal Anglo-Norman,
"Prince Hal" of England, the English dramatist depicts
the <em>man of action</em>; in Hamlet, the brooding Prince of
Denmark, he presents the <em>man of thought</em>. They were
the favorite children of Shakespeare's prolific brain.</p>

<p>"'Tis a scurvy custom and of very ill-consequence,"
says the ingenious Chevalier Montaigne, "that we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in our kingdom of France to call every one by the name
of his manor or seigneury, and the thing in the world that
does the most prejudice and confounds families and
descents.... We need look no further for example than
our own royal family, where every partage creates a new
sir-name, whilst in the meantime the original of the family
is totally lost. There is so great liberty taken in these
mutations that I have not in my time seen any one advanced
by fortune to any extraordinary condition who has not
presently had genealogical titles added to him new and
unknown to his father.</p>

<p>"How many gentlemen have we in France who by their
own talk are of royal extraction? More I think than who
will confess they are not.</p>

<p>"Was it not a pleasant passage of a friend of mine?
There were a great many gentlemen assembled together;
about the dispute of one lord of the manor with another,
which other had in truth some pretty eminence of titles
and alliances, above the ordinary scheme of gentry. Upon
the debate of this priority of place, every one standing up
for himself, to make himself equal to him; one, one extraction,
another another; one the near resemblance of name;
another of arms; another an old worm-eaten patent, and
the least of them great-grandchild to some foreign king.
When they came to sit down to dinner, my friend, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of taking his place amongst them, retiring with most
profound congees, entreated the company to excuse him
for having lived with them hitherto at the saucy rate of
a companion; but being now better informed of their
quality, he would begin to pay them the respect due to
their birth and grandeur; and that it would ill become
him to sit down among so many princes; and ended the
farce with a thousand reproaches.</p>

<p>"<em>Let us in God's name</em>," continues the illustrious
writer, "<em>satisfy ourselves with what our fathers were contented
and with what we are; we are great enough if we understand
rightly how to maintain it; let us not disown the fortune
and condition of our ancestors, and lay aside those ridiculous
pretences that can never be wanting to any one that has the
impudence to alledge them</em>."</p>

<p>The alphabetical series of Norman or Anglo-Norman
names here given was selected by an English scholar from
an English official directory and published, anonymously,
in the latter half of the last century, to illustrate a theory
of the genesis of the English race. The present selection
represents only in part the series or lists originally
published, embracing several thousand names. To this
selection the writer has added Norman or Scandinavian
names from other sources, together with "notes"
that serve to confirm in detail the general theory of inherited
racial traits. The list which he first published has been
greatly enlarged and many additions made from the
original English series.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Freeman says that the Normans "lost themselves"
among the people whom they conquered.
Very clearly, however, the "names" were not
lost. The original Norman may be said to have had,
in a high degree, that <i lang="fr">personnalité absorbante</i> which,
according to Littré, is characteristic of every great man.
It is not remarkable, therefore, that after every Norman
invasion the resulting ethnical transmutation was complete.
The new element became at once the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
vitalizing power of the "absorptive" or subjugated race.
This gift of racial transformation was so great that the
Scandinavians, seizing a Gallic province, became French
or Norman; subjugating England, they became English;
overflowing Ireland, they fused at once with the native
race; actually becoming "<em>Irisher</em> than the Irish" themselves&mdash;<em>Hibernis
ipsis Hiberniores</em>. The Duke of Argyle
once said in the English House of Lords that three of the
Irish leaders of that day (one of them John Redmond,
the present Irish King) were genealogically superior men&mdash;men
of illustrious descent&mdash;leaders of royal or noble Norman
blood; confirming the declaration made by the author
of the "Peerage" that it is not lands but ancestors that
make a nobility. The career of the Norman as a conquering
or migratory race has been a perpetual masquerade;
in England taking the form of an Irishman and controlling
the Parliament; in the same guise leading the armies of
England and France; in America, demoniacally possessed,
becoming the personal director of a lynching, the boss of
a strike, or the leader of a lawless expeditionary force.
But everywhere he <em>leads</em>! The name of the race disappears,
but the original, indestructible, irresistible, invisible
and protean force is still <em>there</em>. If we reject the existence
and operation of this subtle and pervasive influence
in the ancestral strains of Kentucky, the evolution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
typical Kentuckian can not easily be explained. The race
is "lost," not because the visiting Norman is absorbed
by his host, but because the visitor appropriates all that
his host may have, even his personality and all that it
implies. The Englishman, or the Irishman, or the Scotchman,
disappear, and a transmogrified Norman takes his
place. It is not English, nor Irish, nor French absorptiveness,
but Norman appropriativeness, that has done
the work. Precisely thus, to compare great things with
small: the English Whigs once went in swimming, and
the Norman Tories "stole their clothes." But the Norman's
act of appropriation usually goes deeper than the
skin. He is not content with a petty theft of "clothes."
With an almost satanic subtlety and finesse he appropriates
the very soul. It becomes, indeed, his very own.
That incomparable illusionist, Benjamin Disraeli, was a
past-master in these Norman arts, and in perfect sympathy
with those Anglo-Norman Tories who followed his
fortunes in victory or defeat. But Norman or Saxon were
equally indifferent to him. It was glory enough for Semitic
ambition to build success upon the needs of both;
and yet, in doing it, this man of alien blood and ancient
race repeated the miracle of Lanfranc&mdash;the scholar and
statesman who, in the old Norman days, had not only
cooled the hot blood of the Normanized Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and conciliated the respect of the proud, implacable
Saxon, but, linking their interests in inseparable association,
had brightened with a prospect of imperial splendor
the destinies of the common race. So, too, the Semitic
statesman charmed the rudest elements with his Orphean
song. His brilliant successor, Salisbury, added to parts
and learning the technical information of a savant.
Disraeli had something better. He had that deep,
philosophic insight which seems to be bred into the elect
of an ancient stock. It is a mystical gift.</p>

<p>How little escaped the thoughtful eyes of our Semitic
statesman, as he surveyed from his coign of vantage the
shifting currents of our modern world! In depicting Monsignore
Berwick, a descendant of an old Scottish family
that for generations had mingled Italian blood with its
own, the writer looks quite beyond the native environment,
and sees only the old Northern blood in the <em>flaxen
hair</em> and <em>light blue eyes</em> of the young Italian priest. Describing
a nineteenth century function at the beautiful English
home of Hugo Bohun, he sees at once in Mr. Gaston Phoebus&mdash;the
most gifted and attractive of the swells whom
fashion has herded in this social jungle of Bohun&mdash;not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
modern Englishman, but a <em>Gascon noble of the Sixteenth
Century</em>, clothed with all the attractions of a contemporary
courtier of France&mdash;the France of Louis le Grand. In
"Gaston Phoebus"&mdash;says the philosophic statesman&mdash;"Nature,
as is sometimes her wont, had chosen to reproduce
exactly the original type." When the subtle Semitic
thinker introduced an American "Colonel" at the swell
function of Hugo Bohun, why should he take him from
the <em>South</em>, and give him a <em>Norman</em> name? Had nature
reproduced in Colonel Campian the antique Norman type?</p>

<p>It is a notorious fact, says Herbert Spencer, that the
Celtic type disappears altogether in the United States.</p>

<p>Doubtless some vague conception of a potential undercurrent
of ancestral blood must have been passing through
the mind of that fine old gentleman, Mr. Isaac Shelby of
Fayette, when dispensing his stores of bachelor wisdom
to his young friends just "after the war." He would
say, "Depend on it, young gentlemen, there is no cross
like a <em>Virginian</em> cross." The differentiating quality was
there. It was observed, but not accurately depicted perhaps,
by Disraeli, by Barrett Wendell, and by <em>Isaac le
Bon</em>. What was it? If a racial quality, what <em>race</em>?
Two of these acute observers were of Scandinavian stock.
The other did not need to say, even to the proudest statesman
at Potsdam or St. James, "<em>Your</em> race is of but yester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>day
compared with my own." One of Disraeli's favorite
themes was race. Indeed, a statesman could not be
ignorant of the subject in his day. The claims of race
were sweeping over diplomatic arrangements and dynastic
rights. Bismarck was unifying the German people by
removing ancient landmarks, by "appropriating" autonomous
territories, and by appropriating or absorbing a
large population of the Scandinavian race; and the third
(and last) Napoleon undertook to unify the Latin races
by placing an Austrian prince upon the Mexican throne.
But the Napoleonic prince pushed his reconstructive
theories of race to a destructive conclusion when, in freeing
Italy, he furnished a formidable partner to the Triple
Alliance, that ultimately destroyed France. The sentiment
of race, properly directed, has its uses. But the
director must not be a despot or a despot's agent. The
feeling must be popular in origin and expression&mdash;voluntary,
spontaneous, normal, autonomous. There was never
a better illustration of its power than in the prolonged
struggle of Kentucky for existence as an American State.
There was never a better illustration of popular capacity
in statecraft and of enterprise in war than in the early
years of the last century (1800-12). They&mdash;the people&mdash;discharged
the functions of an independent State. Kentucky
was in fact a little <em>nation</em>. Raising and equipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
armies, receiving diplomatic emissaries or agents, defending
her frontiers, guarding the Atlantic border, protecting
the territories of the Northwest, and in conjunction with
the "sea-power" of Commodore Perry actually conducting
war upon foreign soil. The very guns on Perry's ships
were "sighted" by riflemen from Kentucky; and when
the day came to try conclusions with the bold Englishman
on his own soil, one of the most efficient aides upon
Shelby's staff was Perry himself. Is there nothing in this
record to appeal to a sentiment of national pride in the
Kentuckian's heart? And does it not inspire a disposition
to revive and invigorate those pristine instincts of
our common race? Probably the recent manifestation of
"home-coming" sentiment was denotive of some such
stirring of racial impulse and emotion long dormant in
the soul.</p>

<p>When following the long dim path of Gothic migration
we found but little that seemed to be in vivid relation
with the ethnology of our own race; and it was not until
we were afloat upon the Scandinavian seas, with Rolf
Ganger looking out upon the kingdoms of the earth, that
we began to feel ourselves (to speak in paradox) firmly
planted upon historic ground. Here the conditions of the
old parable are reversed. The genius of civilization is
offering the kingdoms of the earth to the Devil himself.
With the old pirate of the Norwegian coast begins the
great movement that frees, elevates, and modernizes man.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Henceforth all is plain sailing for the historical inquirer.
The reader may take down his map and trace the foot-prints
of the Norse freebooters wherever they dropped a
Scandinavian name upon our ancestral soil. These ancient
"place names" are found everywhere north of the Avon,
and may easily be traced along the eastern coast of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
from the Tyne to the Thames; or, proceeding westward
and northward, far beyond the line of the Cheviot Hills;&mdash;far
beyond the waters of the Tweed. The Scandinavian
has resolved to stay wherever he has been planted by the
fortunes of war. When his Norman kinsman seized the
counties of Southern England, the practical result of the
invasion was to <em>reinforce</em> the Anglo-Saxon whom he came
to rob. The Norman invader was warmly received by
those English Normans&mdash;the Danes&mdash;in his "wintry
marches" to the north. From the dragon teeth thus sown
sprang the Kentuckian of to-day, two thirds "dragon"
and one third "bull." The "half horse, half alligator"
was an Anglo-Norman assimilation of a later date.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that by reason of exhausted material
resources&mdash;coal, iron, etc.&mdash;our present splendid civilization,
in the course of a few thousand years, will disappear;
leaving here and there, perhaps, in some happy isle of the
Pacific seas, a prosperous and cultivated population descended
from some surviving element of the present
American stock. Peering painfully through the mists of
tradition, they have vague glimpses of ancestral races
fighting for supremacy in a vast continental war&mdash;the
Yenghees in the North and the Dixees in the South&mdash;remote
ancestral races in internecine conflict.</p>

<p>It was thus with the Teutonic and Scandinavian races of
to-day. In far-off Central Asia, beyond the Caspian Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and beyond the definite historic boundaries of the past,
they see great races in perpetual movement of migration
or war; multitudinous peoples; two distinct groups or
divisions; but all of one race. As they emerge into the
twilight of history&mdash;into the savage gloaming betwixt the
dog and the wolf&mdash;the observer recognizes two races,
the Teutones and the Gothones, or Goths. The vast
migratory columns of the former take possession of Central
Europe. The other column,&mdash;the kindred Gothones or
Goths,&mdash;making its exit from Central Asia, sweeps along
the valley of the Vistula, follows the southern shores of
the Baltic Sea, and moving to the mouths of the Elbe and
the Rhine directs its columns of colonization into Denmark
and the Danish Islands, and to the vast Scandinavian
peninsula of the north. As the northern column loitered
along the shores of the Baltic they gathered great quantities
of amber from the sea, which with early instincts of
commercial thrift they sold to the Teutones on the south,
by whom, with early mechanic aptitude, it was wrought
into many exquisite and profitable shapes for the markets
of the world. "Made in Germany" is an antique trademark
in the history of men, and there is a pleasant, if
trivial, significance in the circumstance that the first historic
article of traffic between these primitive races&mdash;the
founders of modern civilization&mdash;was the substance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
first manifested the property of "electricity" to the eyes
of man.</p>

<p>But in pursuing this inquiry we are less concerned in
ascertaining the exact relations of the ancestral kinsmen
than in studying the ethnic material (in this instance the
Scandinavian) which was molded or modified by the
geographical <em>milieu</em>. What was the moral geography of
the race? Why should the Norseman differ from his
kindred Teuton in the South? There may have been original
differences in the psychology of race which made one,
for example, an explorer and trader, and the other an
unrivaled artisan and exploiter. But there is something
to be considered in the plastic influence of the physical
and social conditions. It is no melodramatic assumption,
for example, to declare that no slave could live in the
free air of Scandinavia. Not because the air is "free,"
but because the soil is thin. The slave could not subsist
himself, much less pay tribute to a lord. If slavery or
serfage was impossible, a nobility was equally so. Where
subsistence was scant, accumulation was at least slow.
Wealth could not exist as a basis of privilege, and class
legislation upon primogeniture gave support to this natural
law. The "five" and "fifty" acre holdings could not be
consolidated into big estates. The rocky ridges, the high
levels, the nipping airs, the thin, worn soil, the short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
seasons, and the fleeting harvests were conditions fatal
to the growth of feudalism. Retainers were superfluous
where slaves could not make their keep. Fish from the
sea, a little pasturage in the glens&mdash;that was all. No
smiling abundant harvests; no patient laborious thralls, no
baronial <em>bas</em> or boss; none of those iron Teutonic laws
that not only shaped the conditions of society but wrought
changes in the very soul of man. The Scandinavians
were not Germans or Saxons or Angles or Celts. This
rocky Scandinavian peninsula was cradling the masters of
the world. They were literally driven by their wild, arid
nurse to follow the furrows of the sea and recast the
corrupted civilizations of the earth. Between the sheltering
group of islands that fringe the western front of Norway
and curtain the main shore, there is a broad passage of
the sea where a navy of dragon-prows might float secure
from observation or attack. Near the center of this
insular barrier, Rolf Ganger&mdash;the greatest force of that
hyperborean world&mdash;had constructed a system of dry-docks,
from which, in the idle hours of summer and
autumn, he launched those portentous fleets of dragons
and serpents that sailed upon every sea and ravaged the
most distant shores. From one point of view, it was a
nest of Scandinavian free-booters; from another, it was
the naval station of a great sea-faring race&mdash;a race that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
having failed as traders in amber and timber and fish,
were now about to try their luck in ravage and loot upon
the gravelly loams of the Cheviot Hills and deep in the
sunny heart of France.</p>

past the Caspian and crossing the Asian frontier, followed
the river valleys and the shores of the Baltic Sea, making
a reconnoissance in force that reached as far as the waters
of the northern sea, it pushed its exploring columns through

and leaving every promontory and peninsula in every
nook and hook and cranny and on every continental
headland, every island inlet, and in every peaceful arm of
the Danish seas strewn with the wrecks of the migrant
column, battered by the hardships of a long, unbroken
march. Only the strong survived. The weak and unenterprising,
as the head of the resistless column bent toward
the northern sea, shrank from the toils and terrors of a
march in a northern clime. Upon these geographical
points of "refuge" the racial weaklings had been gathering
for years. Nothing stayed the mighty Goth. The Norman
could turn the sharpest corners in the Danish world.
Once planted in the footsteps of a pioneer, even a phlegmatic
Teuton might pursue his way. But the exhausted
weakling dropped in his tracks, and crawled to the shelter
of some inviting <i lang="la">angulus</i> or nook. Here they were&mdash;the
drift in the eddy of an archipelagic sea. Jutes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Jutland (in Denmark); <em>Saxons</em> from the shores to the south;
Angles, from the Anglen in Sleswick&mdash;in all a seething
colluvian of ethnic stragglers swarming for an ultimate
raid upon British soil. The great Teutonic nation was
seemingly planted on the best lands of <em>Central Europe</em>;
the great Scandinavian people lay far to the north; the
Jutes, the Angles, the Saxons, the Frisians, <em>lay between</em>;&mdash;the
Angli, who gave their name to England, lying at the
point (<i lang="la">Angulus</i>) where the coast of the Baltic first bends
sharply toward the north. Are these the peoples that
gave substance and strength and splendor to the English
race? The men who fall out in a forced march (said a
great Virginian captain) are not the men to stand up in
a long fight.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the Eighth Century the Scandinavians
of the North began their work of devastation upon
English soil. For at least three centuries the Anglo-Saxons
held the Rover's name in dread. Contemporary
English abounds with Scandinavian words and forms;
numerous traces of Scandinavian occupancy are found
on English soil to-day. The men of the Heptarchy were
in the main bred upon English soil. At least they were
not a broken race of stragglers when they came. They
were a vigorous, fighting breed. But if Bismarck were
looking for "mixed races" in his carefully calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
career of annexation (no "dreaming" here), he certainly
found what he sought at the point where the column of
Goths that had marched from Central Asia, turning its
head to the German Ocean, took courage from the bracing
prospect and&mdash;gathering their veterans into one compact,
invulnerable mass&mdash;debouched boldly toward the vast,
inhospitable regions of the North. The Angles and Saxons
were cradled among the mixed or mongrel peoples that
had been dropped by the great migrant races in the southeastern
corner of the northern sea&mdash;a population, says
Marsh, of "very mixed and diversified blood." These
furnished the original "comelings" upon British soil, but
it is scarcely credible that the outcome of this mongrel
stock was the <em>Anglo-Saxon Race</em>,&mdash;which in the great
Triple Alliance of Norman and Saxon and Dane has
for centuries maintained an unbroken front and kept
the world in awe.</p>

<p>The learned author of "British Family Names," speaking
of certain lists of ancient Norman names alleged to
be authentic, says: "Of this great array of time-honored
names, few are now borne by direct representatives.
They exist among the old gentry rather than in the peerage.
In the majority of cases, the later descendants of
illustrious families have sunk into poverty and obscurity,
unconscious of their origin." They have not "vanished
from the world" (as Mr. Freeman says), but are daily
coming to the front in circumstances requiring capacity
for leadership in affairs. "Even now," says the observant
author of an anonymous treatise,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "agricultural laborers
and coal miners can not combine for objects which demand
the exercise of practical ability without finding themselves
led by those who, though in humble stations, bear names
of undoubted Norman origin," citing, by way of example,
Joseph Arch (<i lang="fr">De Arques</i>, Normandy). These quotations
will fitly introduce to the reader the long and suggestive
alphabetical series of Norman names which the compiler
has made the basis of extended critical remark.</p>

<p>In examining this series, one naturally inquires: How
do we know that the thousands of names, taken from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
old English Directory, are Norman? Simply by the circumstance
that the same names occur in the records of
Normandy in the Eleventh and Twelfth centuries&mdash;the
references in most cases being to the great Rolls of the
Exchequer, 1180-1200. Comparative reference to the English
records at an early date&mdash;Eleventh, Twelfth, and
Thirteenth centuries&mdash;raises a strong presumption that
names appearing on the Norman Rolls <em>before the Conquest</em>,
and on English records <em>after the Conquest</em>, were derived
from Normandy, and that names now accounted <em>English</em>
were originally <em>Norman</em> names. A similar correspondence
between the names in the records of a Virginian court
house and those of official records in Kentucky, to the
mind of a contemporary genealogist, would carry decisive
weight. It is the weight of concurrent testimony of high
character from authentic sources. <i lang="lt">Identitas colligitur ex
multitudine signorum.</i> Even one surname in like circumstances
is a significant record of individual descent. What
shall be said of thousands historically traced&mdash;the continuous
record of a single race? Thirty years ago it was
estimated by an English scholar that the English race
proper comprised thirty millions of people&mdash;a great composite
nation; the Saxon, Dane, and Norman&mdash;a trinity
of races all derived from the same ancient stock (the
Gothic) and each forming about one third of a homogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
race. The Saxon came immediately from the southeastern
shores and islands of the North Sea, and is of
Gothic descent; the Dane from Denmark or the Danish
Isles, and is of pure Scandinavian stock; the Norman
from Normandy, remotely Gothic, is of direct descent
from the Scandinavian race. If this statement be correct
the conclusion seems to be inevitable, <em>not</em> that "we are
Scandinavians"&mdash;as the London <cite>Times</cite> says&mdash;but that we
are all deeply <em>Scandinavianized</em> and that there is a preponderance
of Scandinavian blood in the English race.
If there has been a thorough intermixture of the three
racial elements during the past eight hundred years,
we may assume that every Kentuckian of Anglo-Virginian
stock represents a practically definite ethnical product:
Saxon, one third; Scandinavian, two thirds&mdash;for all controversial
purposes a sufficiently conclusive result. The
long-commingled blood of this composite race is, in effect,
an adamantine cement, and the racial plexus, fusion, or
combination is one and inseparable in every sense. If
it were possible to <em>remove</em> either of these constituent elements&mdash;the
<em>Scandinavian</em> or Saxon&mdash;the Kentuckian in
his present admirable form would disappear and nothing
but a restoration of the racial balance by a reconstitution
of the original parts would restore him to the position of
primacy assigned him by Mr. Bart Kennedy in his recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
contribution to the London <cite>Mail</cite>. How true, then, in a
deep ethnological sense, the familiar legend of our Commonwealth&mdash;"United
we stand, divided we fall."</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is desirable to have it understood
that so long as the Saxon holds his <em>own</em> (and no more)
in the constitution of our common race, there can arise
no possible "unpleasantness" between the parts of which
it is composed. In that duplex anthropoidal abnormity
to which its creator has given a significant binominal
appellation&mdash;<em>Jekyll</em> and <em>Hyde</em>&mdash;some <em>regulative</em> element
seems to be lacking. Is it an element of race? The author
does not say as much in express terms, but apparently
he suggests it in his selection of names. Have we not a
<em>Norman</em> in Mr. Jekyll? And a <em>Saxon</em> in Mr. Hyde? That
we have not a normal Englishman is quite clear. Is the
dominant Scandinavian element <em>short</em>? or has some demoniac
"Berserker" blood slipped into the cross?</p>

<p>Subtle and descriminative writers (such as Stevenson
and Disraeli) do not express themselves after a careless
fashion, as a rule. They mean something, even in the
selection of a name.</p>

<p>There is something, too, no doubt, that appeals to the
popular imagination merely in a <em>Norman</em> name, and Lord
Lytton has cleverly exploited this predilection in many
fascinating volumes of historical romance; tales of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and chivalry that in our soft mid-century days had rivaled,
and for a time eclipsed, the magical creations of Scott.
The later school of Scandinavian writers has not won the
Kentuckian from his early love of English and Scottish
romance. His conception of the actual Scandinavian&mdash;the
Scandinavian in the flesh&mdash;the Scandinavian of to-day,
is still undefined and vague. Until Du Chaillu came he
had given the matter but little thought. And, yet, fifty
years before&mdash;in the busy, brooding twenties&mdash;another
Frenchman, wandering among the Scandinavians of Gothia,
describes their predominant characteristics thus: "Fair
hair, blue eyes, a middle stature, light and slim; a physiognomy
indicating frankness, gentleness, and a certain
sentimental elevation of mind, especially among the fair
sex. The people in the other provinces partake of these
different physical and moral qualities."</p>

<p>How completely this description by a Frenchman in
Scandinavia verifies the casual observation of another
Frenchman in Kentucky! Their hospitality, M. Du
Chaillu informed us in his charming lecture, was almost
without bounds, and at times to a Kentuckian would have
been embarrassing in the extreme, as when those snowy-handed
hostesses bathed the traveler's feet and tucked
him away in bed. But Monsieur seems to have suffered
no embarrassment on this account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the population of the Northern provinces of
Scandinavia there are men of almost gigantic stature,
with dark hair, deep-set eyes, a look somewhat fierce,
but full of expression and vivacity. Their muscles are
large, firm, and distinct, the bones prominent, the features
regular and clear cut. A cheerful temper and "an enterprising
disposition" are qualities common to the whole
population. A stranger is welcome in all circles. Even
in the polar circles the hospitality loses none of its warmth.
Probably it is in dispensing their hospitality that their
passion for "strong liquor" is most marked. This liquor
they drink out of horns; and that is why, said Du
Chaillu, convincingly, that we say in Kentucky, "Will
you take a horn?" But the Kentuckian seems to derive
this peculiarity from every side. "Fill the largest horns,"
said the Saxon, Cedric, when his slaves were arranging the
banquet for his Norman guests.</p>

<p>The impression we derive from the foregoing description
of the Scandinavian physique among the more northern
tribes recalls Professor Shaler's conclusions from a careful
study of the measurement of fifty thousand troops from
Kentucky, made by the astronomer Gould (a distinguished
mathematician), who after the war took service in the
Argentine Republic. "The results," he says, "are surprising.
Their average height was nearly an inch greater than
that of the New England troops; they exceed them equally
in girth of chest, and the circumference of head is also
very much larger. In size they come up to the level of
the <em>picked regiments of the Northern armies</em> of Europe."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Yet these results were obtained from what was a levy
<i lang="fr">en masse</i>. It did not include "the rebel exiles" who were
the "first running from the press," or, as is often said,
"the flower of the State," and being in the main of a more
exuberant habit of body would doubtless have given
still better results. It is questionable if all Scandinavia
could furnish two such <em>heads</em> as William Nelson's and
Humphrey Marshall's. <i lang="la">Ceteris paribus</i>, said Leidy, "size
is a measure of power"&mdash;referring to <em>size of head</em>. When
General Marshall was warned that his great size would
attract the attention of <em>sharpshooters</em>, he answered, "I
have provided for that. I have a <em>fat staff</em>. There be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<em>six</em> Richmonds in the field!" His aide and secretary was
a Norman of wholly different type; of a slight figure, but
of an activity, courage, vivacity, and endurance wholly
unsurpassed. Captain Shaler (himself a capable soldier,
with a strong dash of New England blood) singles out for
special commendation the soldiers and officers of Morgan's
command. He especially notes their high social quality,
their physical vigor and activity, their endurance under
severe tests, and their peculiar aptitude and penchant
for the business of war. He waxes vigorously poetic
in describing the martial qualities of the "Orphan Brigade."</p>

<p>Hereditary surnames are said to be memorials of race
that can never be obliterated. If thousands of men, swept
along in some great historic migratory movement which
is followed and described by critical observers through
country after country, through century after century,
never "breaking ranks" except to plant and build, leaving
the same names upon the official records of every dukedom,
or kingdom, or commonwealth through which they
pass; when their names, their features, their instincts,
their mental habits, their daily speech, their terms of law,
the language and routine of their courts, are impressed
with the same ethnic stamp; when the same mental,
physical, and moral characteristics are manifest generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
after generation; when myriads of minute resemblances
confirm the conclusions of the larger view, why lose one's
self in the haunting mystery of apparent discrepancies in
detail? Let us give full credit to each member of the
triune ethnical Trust&mdash;which is charged with all the responsibilities
of this magnificent modern world. If you wish
to know how much can be said to thrill with delight that
old <span class="smcap">Saxon</span> element of your blood, read what the Count
de Montalembert (another Frenchman) has said in his
"Monks of the West." The enormous difficulties encountered
by the Church in that old chaotic day approximately
measure the shortcomings of the race. That the crude,
repulsive Saxon should have been fashioned into the noble
figure which Montalembert describes, speaks well for the
essential worth of the <em>Saxon</em>; but what a tribute to the
miraculous power of the <em>Monk</em>!</p>

<p>In the original prolusion and in the present preface the

In pursuing this work, he becomes the genealogist of a
race. Names of localities, names of men, are subject&mdash;like
all other words&mdash;to every variety of phonetic change,
and, it may be said, are in a perpetual state of flux. But
there is a soul that survives all changes. It is for the
scholar to catch it on the wing and fix a fleeting syllable
for all time.</p>

<p>The student who is interested in this subject may find
some help in the following series of <span class="smcap">Names</span> (to which frequent
reference has been made), compiled by an anonymous
English scholar whose learning and ability have been
recognized in the critical reviews. It was to one of these
reviews that the present writer was indebted for suggestions
that at once quickened his interest in M. Du Chaillu
and his researches, and induced him in the republication
of the English writer's list (taken from a London Directory)
to add to the selections a few names of obvious
Scandinavian derivation&mdash;Danish, Swedish, and Old Norse.
Any fixed rule of selection, in a discussion like this, it is
difficult to apply. Readers who comprehend how easily
errors creep into an ordinary record of "family" pedigrees
will make due allowance for errors that may be found in
this modestly illustrative Anglo-Norman list, in which
there is but little attempt to trace lineal family descent.
With a body of names so pregnant with significance as
this, the credentials of any branch of the Anglo-Norman
race in any part of the earth will be recognized as good.
The difficulties of the problem are apparent to all. Its
interest and importance it is impossible to exaggerate or
deny. If more simply stated, probably it were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
easily understood, but, failing in simplicity of statement,
very frequent <em>repetitions</em> may be excused.</p>

<p>The origin of the general discussion ought to encourage
every scholar. According to the pleasing conception of
the great Scottish romancer, the originator of this controversy
was a Saxon slave who understood the art of deducing
philosophic conclusions from unconsidered trifles. While
herding his master's swine in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
he spoke to a fellow thrall who stalked about in the
full enjoyment of Saxon freedom with a brazen collar about
his neck:</p>

<p>"And <em>swine</em> is good English," said the jester. "But
how call you the sow when she is flayed, drawn and quartered,
and hung up by the heels like a traitor?"</p>

<p>"Pork," said Gurth.</p>

<p>"And <em>pork</em>, I think, is good Norman French. When
alive and in charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by a <em>Saxon</em>
name. She is a <em>Norman</em> when dressed for the table in the
castle hall. What dost thou think of <em>that</em>, friend Gurth?"</p>

<p>"It is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, <em>however
it got into thy fool's pate</em>."</p>

<p>This is elementary, but it was an inspiration to one of
the greatest writers of France. The nimble wits of
the Scottish wizard are not at the service of all the
Wambas of the Saxon race.</p>

<p>"The Norman has vanished from the world,"
says Mr. Freeman, "but he has indeed left a name
behind him"; and not only the "name," but wherever
found he still exhibits "the indomitable vigor of the
Scandinavian with the buoyant vivacity of the Gaul."
It must be remembered, in discussing so large and complicated
a subject as this, that philosophic scholarship is
seldom narrow, absolute, final, or exclusive in its views.
It would be folly to affirm, says the anonymous English
writer who anticipated in certain aspects the theories of
Du Chaillu, that the possession of Norman and Danish
blood "always implies energy and intellect; and Saxon
descent, the reverse." We have too much evidence to the
contrary. It is not individual instances that are now under
consideration; it is the comparative qualities of <em>race</em>. We
can only safely affirm, in a rational and considerate discussion
of the question, that our people are not Saxons nor
Scandinavians, nor Normans, but broadly speaking, are
a great branch of the English race which happily mingles
the highest qualities of the <span class="smcap">THREE</span>; the stolid conservatism
of the first, the daring enterprise of the second, the "buoyant
vivacity," the "spontaneity, enthusiasm, and versatility"
of the third. When these racial elements were fairly
balanced, as in the time of Elizabeth, the evolution of the
Englishman was complete. It was then that, surcharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
with complex currents of racial vitality, the adventurous
"Elizabethan" sought our shore. The Virginian hunter
followed or formed a trail in every wilderness, and the
Yankee skipper trafficked on every coast. The march
begun in Central Asia was resumed upon the American
Continent, and "the most dramatic spectacle in history"
was gradually unfolded before the eyes of men.</p>

<p>We should find many Anglo-Norman or Scandinavian
names upon the company rolls of that vast host. Many
of these names we have already heard, and, beside the bold
Norman, others walk unseen&mdash;men of blended races cast
in the same heroic mold. It is the mark of a "true Kentuckian"
that, like the amiable and sagacious Isaac le
Bon, he appreciates a good "cross," and to the end of
time he will carry the cross which was originally stamped
upon his English ancestor in the ancient nursery of the
race. He has no quarrel, therefore, with his Anglo-Saxon
blood. "Nature," as Mr. Disraeli says: "natural selection,"
as others say, seems to delight in working with a
purpose and upon a plan; and, when impelled to frame
a creature that could do the work which apparently
the Anglo-Norman was called to do, she seems to have
found her model in the man of ancient <span class="smcap">Rome</span>: she made
him <em>strong</em>&mdash;a man of oak and bronze.</p>

<p><i lang="la">Illi tobur et æs</i> <span class="smcap">Triplex</span>. Some of the elements may
be crude, but <em>all</em> must be strong. A Roman trireme might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
safely carry a Vergilian body and an Horatian soul; but
only a vessel framed with the toughest constituents at
Nature's command could carry for century after century,
in every land, upon every sea, in the "teeth of clenched
antagonisms," and upon fixed predestinated lines, the
fortunes of the English or "Anglo-Norman" race.</p>

<p>In point of fact, <span class="smcap">Destiny</span> itself seems to have directed
the process of evolution when the germ-plasm of those
picked races&mdash;the Norman, the Saxon, and the Dane&mdash;was
united to create the English or Anglo-Norman race,
the Norman element by virtue of peculiar traits being
dominant in the "cross." The Kentuckian is no degenerate
product of this magnificent ancestral "blend," and one
of the objects of the "Names" and the accompanying
"Notes" is to show that in every characteristic respect
he has bred true to the ancient blood. If the storm of
Norman conquest scarcely touched the solid elements of
that old manorial life, so the continuous intermingling,
through many centuries, of the blood of three remotely
kindred races has served to fix and transmit the characteristic
traits which are stamped upon the Kentuckian of
to-day.</p>

<p>Perhaps no critic has thrown more light upon
mediæval history than Mr. Freeman, who in his discriminating
analysis of the Norman character declares the supreme,
the directive, the dominant quality to be <em>craft</em>: a special
power of intellect which seems to have been created or
evolved by the necessities of those times&mdash;intellect fused
with instinct and directed by a conscienceless common
sense. Mr. Freeman detected its manifestations in all
the Norman's great affairs. In legal proceedings, in
court intrigues, in ecclesiastical relations; in diplomatic
affairs, in local or in provincial administration, and, most
notable of all, in the <em>conduct of war</em>. It was in <em>war-craft</em>
that the Saxon fell short. If success in battle had come
with a sturdy frame, a stout heart, and a short sword,
the Saxon would seldom have failed in war. But he was
not strong (Mr. Freeman says) in "the wiles of war."
From the very outset the Scandinavian has won battles
by sheer weight of brain, and nature certainly "turned
loose a thinker" when she projected a Scandinavian freebooter
upon the soil of France.</p>

<p>This attribution of craft, and all that it implies, to the
Norman, does not rest solely upon the deductions of a
studious historian. The conception did not originate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the closet of a scholar; it seems to have come first from
the "great common people"; from the field, from the
market, the fireside, and the street. It is proverbial in
the speech of France.</p>

<p>"C'est un Normand, c'est un fin Normand, c'est un
Normand, adroit.</p>

<p>"Réponse normande, réponse ambiguë. Que cela peut
être vrai est peut être faux; la réponse est un peu normande."</p>

<p>These popular conceptions of the Norman character
did not necessarily imply disparagement or reprobation.
On the contrary, in that wild mediæval struggle for
existence, astuteness and duplicity were the winning
cards. In the councils of the forest the popular favorite,
Renard, was at the front. Even the imperious Isangrim
was handicapped by lack of wit: a deprivation not unlike
that of the clawless cat in Hades.</p>

<p>This sinister and sagacious quality of the Norman
intellect seems to have had full play through all the varied
experiences of the race; but its most enduring effects were
visible in the great triune nationality evolved upon English
soil. It quickened the sluggish wits of the Saxon; it
tempered the rudeness and ferocity of the Dane, and became
a shaping factor in the civilization of the world.</p>

<p>The "Names" which follow, and the occasional "Notes"
that accompany them, are intended to illustrate the theory
of descent which has been advocated in this discussion.
To find a large body of people in Kentucky derived from
English sources and bearing Norman surnames is in itself
a circumstance of peculiar interest and of almost conclusive
weight. But to find noted in connection with an hereditary
surname certain characteristics that are common
to two races and apparently derived along certain historic
lines from the same ethnical source, materially strengthens
the argument in favor of the assumed origin of the
later or remoter race; and if, therefore, we conclude that
the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky are derived
from that old Norman strain, we ought to be able to indicate
without difficulty characteristic and conspicuous
points of resemblance between the original and the derivative
stock. Taking in hand the exact and vivid characterization
of the old Norman by the contemporary chronicler,
Malaterra, we ask ourselves, "Are the Kentuckians
also marked by the characteristics here described?" Are
they persuasive orators, able lawyers, brilliant fighters,
ready and practical thinkers; astute and successful negotiators?
Have they scholarly tastes? Social gifts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
accomplishments? A passion for travel, exploration, adventure,
field sports, and fine horses? "I like him very
much," said the English swell St. Aldegonde, speaking
of Colonel Campian, the Southern colonel. "He knows
all about horses and tobacco."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>A little information of this kind ought to be found in
our "Notes" by way of giving confirmation to the inference
suggested by the "Names." There is something in
the name, but not everything. We have a notable&mdash;a
brilliant&mdash;example in the current history of a Kentuckian
who is a Norman in almost everything except
the name, and he belongs to a family that is characteristically
Norman in many respects; and yet it has borne
with great distinction for generations a fine old Saxon
name. Not a few of our leading families are in the same
category. The impartial agencies of evolution have given
them their due proportion of Norman or Scandinavian
blood, the name being a secondary consideration with
the evolutionary Fates.</p>

<p>Note the broad and generous philosophy in these lines;
and, some might add, the imaginative touch which almost
gives the quatrain a poetic value. The Kentuckian, at
least, has but little reason to criticise the stuff of which
he is made, particularly since he stands easily <em>first among
the modern races of men</em>. This is an estimate from an
impartial source&mdash;a writer for the English press.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Is it

<p>There came at last a shadow over our memory of the
bright Arcadian days. "The beautiful Scandinavian"
was fatally stricken in her prime by an insidious malady
which gradually sapped her strength but scarcely touched
the saint-like beauty which was the glory and charm of
her youth. The Great Traveler, who construed at a glance
the ethnical significance of those embodied charms, has
long ago passed to his eternal rest. In her children she
seems to live again. Her sons&mdash;handsome young Scandinavians
of the higher type&mdash;are winning success and
distinction in the great industrial movements of the times;
and her beautiful daughter, vividly reproducing the attractions
of the mother, is a passionate lover of travel, and
but recently has demonstrated the Scandinavian quality
of her blood in the midst of a terrific nine days' storm
that swept the seas near the coast of Japan.</p>

<p>With this parting glance at the impressive figures which
appeared in the early pages of this paper, the "explanatory
preface" comes to a close; and the reader&mdash;the patient
reader&mdash;is at last introduced to a rare lexicon of Names&mdash;names
which carry on their light wings the histories of
States and men. Here the humblest scholar may read
without effort, in almost continuous narrative, the marvelous
story of three kindred stocks transmuted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
fires of internecine conflict into one invincible race, which
after centuries of almost unbroken struggle in peace and
in war may almost be said to have made the earth its own.
What part it has played in the genesis of our own Commonwealth,
each student of this "lexicon" must judge for
himself, remembering that the decision of this question
must rest upon a clear judicial faculty at last. Many
"names" might be added, but here mere numbers do
not count. "To the quick eye of genius"&mdash;says Max
Müller&mdash;"one case is like a thousand"; and it may be
that the scholarly enquirer will find in the brilliant
Du Chaillu an illustration of this maxim of the great
German scholar.</p>

<p>[The learned Canon of Carlisle assures us that not only
has Normandy supplied us with many of our family names,
but it enjoys the distinction of having been the first to
establish an hereditary surname. Few stop to consider
that a surname thus conceived is not merely an heraldic
vanity or device to give social dignity and distinction to
those who bear it, but is in reality a scientific advance in
the working nomenclature of a race. If to "name" is
but to classify, the addition or introduction of the surname
simply adds completeness and precision to the racial
classification. Here, then, we have in the following list
a large body of surnames coming almost directly from
the land in which surnames are said to have originated.
If a name, therefore, be merely that by which a thing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
known, it would seem that a people who have borne
these names continuously (as is historically attested) for
<i>eight hundred years</i> have in all likelihood inherited the
characteristic traits, as well as the distinctive surnames,
of the antique Norman race. In Kentucky, the original
tone and vigor of the Norman people are unimpaired.
Changes there have been; changes there will be; but,
whatever changes may occur, there remains this one unalterable
characteristic of the Norman race, that "the more
you change it, the more it is the same."]</p>

in any country, community,
or social circle. His son,
William Lytle Blanchard, an
accomplished gentleman, was

associate of Halliday (and other
Anglo-Normans) in the establishment
of the great overland
route. William Lytle Blanchard
was a first cousin of
General William Haynes Lytle,

<p class="hang"><i>Blessett</i>, for Blissett.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Blews</i>, a form of Blew or Blue.
Etard de Blew occurs in Kent,

Essex. The name is a form of
Bloi, Bloin, or Blohin of Bretagne,
often written Blue. Vide

<p class="hang"><i>Blizard</i>, Blizart. Perhaps from
Blesum, Blois, meaning a native
of Blois. The name is evidently
foreign. Blizzard, Blizard,
Blezard, Blizart, Blissett.
Even the best authorities
have differed as to the origin
of this name. One English
writer says: "Perhaps it is
from Blesum, Blois, meaning a
native of Blois" (Blizzard, which
is Norman, is an analogous
form). Another and later English
authority says: "Blizard,
Blezard, from the Danish Blichert,
a strong sword player."
A correspondent of the New
York Tribune, July 19, 1891,
says: "The old English word
blizzard, which describes so
picturesquely the English snow-blast,
is spoken of as an 'Americanism.'
Even such philologists
and lexicographers as Murray
treat the word as a recent
'Americanism.' So far from
its being American in origin,
it was not till within the last
thirty years (according to Bartlett
and other American philologists)
that the word was ever
heard in the Eastern States,
and in the Western a 'blizzard'
meant a knock-down
blow&mdash;not from a snow-blast,
but in an argument."</p>

<p class="hang">In reality, Blizzard is an old
English surname, and is doubtless
of Norman origin. In April,
1889, the writer of this note
conversed with a Federal soldier,
whose full name was
Stephen Decatur Blizzard. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
was of Anglo-Virginian stock;
he was a soldier in the Civil
War, and his name may still be
found on the National Pension
Rolls of that date. His postal
address in 1889 was "Quincy,
Lewis County, Kentucky."</p>

<p class="hang">Possibly the "snow-blast"
took its name from some windy
Anglo-Norman disputant, who
wielded the sword of the spirit
and dealt in apostolic blows
and knocks.</p>

<p class="hang">The word "blizzard" does
not appear in Worcester's dictionary,

<p class="hang"><i>Blue</i>, Blew or Blews. Etard de

(France). The original Norman
form was Le Bleu. During the
Civil War there came before
one of our Kentucky courts
a case in which there was
a very interesting introduction
of names that
have been long traditionally
associated&mdash;Black and Blue;
the former the name of a great
criminal lawyer (Jeremiah S.
Black), and the latter the name
of his client, Blew or Blue, the
perpetrator of an atrocious
crime. The case showed that
the criminal was sadly "off"
on color. He had killed an
entire family of blacks; but was
finally acquitted by the ingenuity
and perseverance of his
great "Scandinavian" lawyer.</p>

1180. The name Brunus
or Le Brun frequently occurs
in Normandy, 1180-98. Many
Normans were Brun, or Browne;
but, in England, all Brownes
were not Norman. The line of
Hanno le Brun, Cheshire, temp.
Henry II, is armorially connected
with an Irish line. William
Brone witnessed the charter
of Dunbrody, 1178; Nigel le
Brun had a writ of military
summons, 1309, and Fremond
Bruyn was one of the barons of
Ireland, 1315-17. Richard de la
Ferte accompanied Robert of
Normandy to Palestine in 1096.
He had eight sons, the youngest
of whom, surnamed Le Brun,
settled in Cumberland, where
he had baronial grants, temp.
Henry I. The family of De la
Ferte, also called Le Brun, long
flourished in Cumberland. The
name Le Brun gradually changed
to Broyne, Brown, and Browne.
Robert le Browne, M. P. for
Cumberland, 1317-1339, was
grandfather of Robert, from
whom descended the Viscounts
Montague, the Marquises of
Sligo, and the Barons Kilmaine.</p>

military array at Oxford. From
this family descended Sire Robert
Brudenell, Chief Justice of
the Common Pleas, 1520. The
orthographic modifications of
this Norman patronymic (from
Bretignolles to Bredenell, to
Bredenhill, and Brudenel) are
clearly traceable upon the
records.</p>

of <i>equus</i>, for horse. It was so
used in Domesday Book, and it
seems certain, says Doctor
Brown, that the family derived
its surname from that word.
Hence, also, <i>caballero</i>. Doctor
Brown gives at least forty-six
different ways of spelling the
name. Geoffrey Cabell owned
land in Caux, Normandy, in
1180. The Cabells of Virginia
are descended from the Cabells
of France, in Somersetshire.

<p class="hang"><i>Chenoweth.</i> The history of this
name is of peculiar interest.
John Trevelesick, according to
an old London record, married
Elizabeth Terrel. Their son,
John, received from his father
a tract of land upon which he
built a house, and called the
place "Chenoweth," doubtless
from an oak grove or woods
upon the land. The initial
syllable of the name is not
uncommon in the genealogical
nomenclature of Normandy;
and Cornwall is notably a land
of Norman castles and druidical
groves of oak. The Trevelesick
family, as was a custom of the
period, took the name of the
<i>place</i>, and was henceforth known
as "Chenoweth." This change
may have been partly induced
by the circumstances that there
was a law which required the
people to take names that were
"easy" to the English. There
seems to have been an early
etymological connection between
the familiar Virginian
names "Chenoweth" and
"Chinn." Vide Chinn, Cheyne,
Chêne, Chenoie, and the Scandinavian
suffix <i>with</i>. In a list of
names from Domesday Book
we note the following: Cheneuvard,
Chenuard, Cheuvin, Chenut.

<p class="hang">(1) The Collins family or families
of Kentucky have been
notably distinguished. General
Richard H. Collins was a lawyer
of great ability. His sons,
also lawyers, were brilliant and

bar, and a partner of Senator
Pugh. Charles and William

<p class="hang">(2) Judge Lewis Collins was
a native of Kentucky and

highest character. His history
of Kentucky, a valuable work,
was officially recognized by the
Legislature of the State. His

ability, continued his father's
historic labors; revised the volume

settled in Ireland, temp. Henry.
In this instance the new settler
took the prefix <i>Mac</i>, not an
uncommon occurrence in those
days. The native "Macs" and
"O's" of Ireland were never at
peace, and the Galwagians repudiated
both. When the Normans
came they gave the Celts
"<i>Fitz</i>," and characteristically
enough the Celts, who were dissatisfied
with "O" and "Mac,"
have been having "Fitz" ever
since. Lower says that English
settlers sometimes assume
the prefix "Mac," apparently
from a desire of assimilation to
the Celtic race. In Ireland "O"
was held in higher esteem than
"Mac" In Scotland, it was
just the reverse.</p>

John Crittenden, was an
officer in the Revolutionary
War. He came to Kentucky
at the close of that struggle,
and settled in Woodford, the
heart of this State. His sons,
John, Thomas, and Robert,
were eminent at the bar, and
Henry, who devoted his life to
agriculture, was equally conspicuous
for talent. John J.
Crittenden received his elementary
education at the local
schools; afterwards attended
Washington Academy (now
Washington-Lee University),
and completed his studies at
William and Mary. The effect
of his classical training is shown
in the clearness, finish, and
felicity of his published speeches;
his peculiar power in forensic
oratory must always be a
matter of tradition.</p>

in his graphic "Century" narrative

Davis, records the last "War"
speech of the Southern President.
It was addressed to a
column of cavalry, under the
command of General Duke, at
Charlotte, N. C., the soldiers
waving their flags and hurrahing
for "Jefferson Davis." The
speech was brief. He thanked
them for their cordial greeting;
complimented the gallantry and
efficiency of the Kentucky cavalrymen;
and expressed his
determination not to despair of
the Confederacy, but to remain
with the last organized band,
"upholding the flag." This was
all. He said later to his faithful
Secretary, "I can not feel like
a beaten man."</p>

<p class="hang">In a private letter written by
Secretary Harrison to his
mother about this time (unpublished),
he says: "Thaddeus
Stevens recently sent us an
offer to become one of Mr.
Davis' counsel if it were agreeable
to us to have him serve."
Mr. Harrison's letters to his
family are admirably written
and full of interest.</p>

<p class="hang">It was the trained sagacity
of an English statesman
which in the midst of universal
doubt and misconception enabled
him to comprehend at a
glance the difficulties encountered
by Jefferson Davis in bringing
order out of the wild chaos
of secession in the Southern
States. "He has created a
Nation"&mdash;said Mr. Gladstone.
Doubtless, posterity, in full possession
of the facts, will be disposed
to let the judgment
stand. These facts have never
been more ably and accurately
stated than in the eulogy by
Colonel William C. P. Breckinridge
upon that able and daring
pilot in this great extremity of
the South. The eulogist was
competent to speak; he was
early in the field; he was close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to the inner councils of the
war; he saw and shared the
struggle in every phase; and at
the close, he calmly accepted
the results. His clear and rapid
summary will carry historic
weight:</p>

<p class="hang">"When the world once understands
how it was possible
for the government, inaugurated
at Montgomery, without
a battalion of soldiers, or a ship
of war, without arms or munitions
of war, without provisions
and military stores; a government
not possessing within its
borders a single factory at
which a single weapon of war,
or a single part of a weapon of
war, could be manufactured,
without credit or funds; a
nation with her ports soon
blockaded so as to be deprived
of access to the markets of the
world; a republic composed
nominally of thirteen separate
States, of which Kentucky, Tennessee
and Missouri were practically
under the control of its
enemy&mdash;how such a nation
could maintain such a war for
a period of four years against
the United States of America,
and bring into the field an army
more numerous than its entire
adult white population, feed it,
clothe it, transport it, arm it,
take care of it and keep it in
such condition that it won
unprecedented victories, has
been an unsolved mystery.
When it is added that during
those years personal freedom
was maintained, order preserved,
courts kept open and
no rights usurped, thinkers will
conclude that he who was the
head and life, the spirit and
chief must have been a very
great man."</p>

<p class="hang">The London <i>Times</i>, in its
obituary notice, said: "As he
was the first to perceive the
true nature of the struggle, so
was he the last to admit that
the battle was lost. He fought
a losing battle with unquestionable
ability and unflinching
courage. His achievements
will secure him an honorable
place in his country's history."</p>

<p class="hang">In the last public address of
Jefferson Davis, delivered in
the capitol of Mississippi to the
Legislature in joint convention,
he said: "The people of the Confederate
States did more in proportion
to their numbers and
men than was ever achieved by
any people in the world's history.
Fate decreed that they
should be unsuccessful in the
effort to maintain their claim

Federal Government. Our people
have accepted the decree;
it, therefore, behooves them,
as they may, to promote the
general welfare of the Union;
to show to the world that hereafter,
as heretofore, the patriotism
of our people is not measured
by the lines of latitude and
longitude, but is as broad as
the obligations they have assumed
and embraces the whole
of our ocean-bound domain.
Let them leave to their children
and children's children the
grand example of never swerving
from the path of duty, and
preferring to return good for
evil rather than to cherish
the unmanly feeling of revenge."</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Desha.</i> (Fr. Deshayes.) A grandson
of Governor Desha of Kentucky,
visiting many years ago
the Valley of Wyoming, the
ancestral home-place of the
Desha family, found a venerable
scion of the pioneer stock,
who invariably spelt his name
Deshay. Fields, woods, hedges,
etc., give surnames to families.
In the following line from an
old French writer we find two
family names, or at least words
familiarly used as such:&mdash;<i>On
lui dressoit des sentiers au travers
des hayes de leurs bois</i>. The
name Desha is accented on the
second syllable, in Kentucky,
this doubtless being the original
pronunciation as implied by
the ancestral orthography&mdash;"Deshay."
Beyond the Seine
in old Paris; beyond the Latin
Quarter and the Faubourg St.
Germain, near the fortifications,
there stands&mdash;or did
stand in the closing quarter of
the last century&mdash;a block of
antique villas. One of these
was known as the <i>Villa Deshayes</i>.
Captain Deshayes, of
the French man-of-war <i>Le Grand
Joseph</i>, made a gallant fight
against two British frigates
during the Colonial wars.</p>

<p class="hang">General Joseph Desha, after
a brilliant military and polit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>ical
career, became Governor
of Kentucky in 1824.
His administration (says Collins,
the old Whig historian) was
strong and efficient. The message
of Governor Desha of
Kentucky, November 7, 1825,
says Professor W. G. Sumner
of Yale, "deserves attentive
reading from any one who
seeks to trace the movement of
decisive forces in American
political history."</p>

<p class="hang">Judge Bledsoe (the father-in-law
of Governor Desha) is
reported to have said that
"Desha commenced his career
with as sound a set of politics
as any man in Kentucky, but
it was his misfortune never to
change them."</p>

<p class="hang">Even Desha's enemies concede
that he made a brilliant
and impressive appearance upon
the hustings. His handsome
person and carriage contributed
much to this effect. He is
described in that Hudibrastic
skit, "The Stumpiad" (1816):</p>

naturally assume the Celtic prefix,
"Mac," as in like circumstances
English settlers have
done. In Lord Stair's list of

<p class="hang"><i>Drake.</i> There is no reason to
doubt that the Drakes of Devon
were all originally of the same
race. They bore a dragon
(Draco), showing that their
name had been Draco. The
father of Daniel Drake came to
Kentucky in the closing years
of the Eighteenth Century, settling
in the rich bluegrass county
of Mason. Along with a rifle
and an axe, he brought five
books to the wilds of Kentucky,
to wit, a Bible, a hymn book,
an arithmetic, a spelling book,
and the "Famous History of
Montellion, a Romance of the
Ages of Chivalry." "The Letters
of Lord Chesterfield,"&mdash;borrowed
by the father of
Daniel from a friend in the
neighboring Virginian colony&mdash;"fell
in mighty close"&mdash;says
the son&mdash;"with the tastes of
the whole family." Chesterfield
and Montellion:&mdash;ideal educators
even in this "school of the
woods," as it was happily
termed by its most distinguished
graduate, Doctor Daniel Drake.</p>

<p class="hang">Daniel Drake was not only a
skillful physician and accomplished
scholar, but he was the
founder of a famous medical
school, and an author whose
productions, in the estimation
of competent critics, have given
him and his country a splendid
and enduring renown. His elaborate
and systematic treatise
upon the Diseases of the Valley
of the Mississippi is a work which
lays broad the foundations of
medico-geographical research in
the Western Hemisphere, and
foreshadows in masterly fashion
the rigorous methods of physical
science that are now universally
in vogue. The author was
an explorer by right of birth.
He was a true son of his pioneer
father, and a typical scion of an
adventurous race. The daring
navigator, Sir Francis Drake,
the son of a Devonshire yeoman,
was a true kinsman in spirit,
and probably in blood. The
same passion for exploration
which drove the one to circle
the universal seas in an English
keel inspired the other to toil
through the vast spaces of a
continental wilderness and
explore the haunts of pestilence
upon the shores of the Mexican
Gulf. It is doubtless as the
author of that unique work&mdash;"The
Diseases of the Great
Interior Valley"&mdash;that Daniel
Drake will chiefly be remembered,
and certainly no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
could desire a better title to
remembrance. The motto of
his famous "Journal," <span class="smcap">E Sylvis
Nuncius</span>, is a succinct and
happy characterization of the
man. He was indeed an ambassador
from nature, and his credentials
have passed unchallenged
to this day.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Durrell</i>, from Durell. Armorially
identified with Darrell, Durrant,
Durran, Durrock, and possibly
Durrett. (Vide Durrett.) Note
how slight a change converts
the Norman name Clarte into
Claret. So, Druett into Durrett.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Durrett.</i> A surname traceable
beyond the Conquest, and having
all the marks of a Norman
surname. If not of literal
record in our various lists, it is
evidence of defect in the list
itself. It is a familiar tradition
in Colonel Paul Durrett's family
that the original form of the
surname was <i>Duret</i>, and that
the family was of French extraction.
Widely separated branches
of the same stock have the
same tradition. Every village
in Normandy&mdash;says Camden&mdash;has
"surnamed" a family in
England. It is easy to perceive,
therefore, that the number of
surnames thus derived, added
to the number derived from
other sources, would oblige the
compilers of genealogical dictionaries
from sheer exhaustion
to <i>omit</i> many names. There is a
simple process of linguistic
mutation which explains the
genesis of many words. It is
known as <i>transposition</i>. It may
be a transposition of <i>letters</i>, as
in the simple name <i>Crisp</i>, transpose
the terminal letters and
we have the familiar name
<i>Crips</i>; or it may be a transposition
of <i>syllables</i>, of which we
have a famous example in <i>Al-macks</i>,
<i>decelticized</i> for Anglican
uses by a simple transposition
of the syllables in the Celtic
surname&mdash;<i>Mack-All</i>. So, Durand,
Durant (vide Battle
Abbey Roll and D. B.),
DeRuelle, Durelle, Druell, Durell,
Durel, Durell (Huguenot,
London, 1697), Durrell; so, too,
Drouet (Nor. Fr.), Druet, Druett,
Durrett. <i>Duré</i> is a French
surname easily Normanized by
the addition of the diminutive
suffix <i>et</i> or <i>ett</i>, giving us Duré,
Duret, or Durett; and when
consonantally <i>braced</i> (more
Anglico) by doubling the "r,"
we have <i>Durrett</i>&mdash;a familiar
surname in Kentucky. <i>Dur</i>,
the adjective, means <i>hard, durable,
enduring</i>; the noun <i>Dur</i>
is <i>door</i>; <i>ett</i> is a Norman suffix;
giving the ancient surname
<i>Durrett</i> a characteristic Norman
stamp, structure, and <i>cachet</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Hamilton.</i> A well-known family
in Kentucky.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Hamilton.</i> Gilbert de Hamelden
had estates in Surrey, holding
his lands from the Honour of
Huntingdon, and, therefore,
from the Kings of Scotland
(1254). His elder son, Walter,
was one of the Barons of Scotland,
and held the barony of
Hamilton. The family dates
from Normandy, 1130. The
most illustrious descendant of
this noble Scottish family was
an American&mdash;Alexander Hamilton&mdash;who,
according to that
very eminent authority, Prince
Talleyrand, "was the greatest
man of his epoch," an epoch
illustrated by such names as
Napoleon and Washington&mdash;his
greatness consisting peculiarly
in this, that he was not
only variously gifted&mdash;soldier,
scholar, orator, administrator,
political philosopher and financier,
but, like William of Normandy,
he was a creative or
constructive statesman, and his
mother, like the Maiden of
Falaise, was a daughter of
France. In a brilliant and powerful
work descriptive of his
life, he is fitly styled the "Conqueror,"
and an American Senator,
writing upon the same
lines, adopts practically the
same views. The discussion in
both instances is conducted
with perfect frankness and in
perfect taste. In a speech
at the recent Home-Coming in
Louisville, an eloquent Kentuckian
made felicitous reference
to a similar instance in
which (it was alleged) destiny
(or subterranean tradition) had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
assigned to a daughter of the
people the same illustrious rôle.
Whatever the facts, there is a
philosophy that rises above conventions;
precisely as if it
should say&mdash;"In the higher
planes of life, the conceptions
of social evolution are sometimes
predestinated and immaculate."
Who knows? Thus
much at least may be conceded
to the maiden of the wilderness,
to the daughter of the tropics,
and to the Maiden of Falaise,
that no three women who have
figured in profane history as
the mothers of great men have
more profoundly affected the
destinies of the English or
Anglo-Norman race.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Hancock.</i> Hancoc or Hencot&mdash;These

changed to Hancock.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Hanks.</i> According to Lower, an
old Cheshire "nick"-name of
Randolph. The name Randolph
has given rise to many "diminutives,"
as Rankin, Randolph,
Randy, Ranson, Hankin,
Hankey, Hanks, resembling in
this respect the prolific "Peter"
(q.v.). In the struggle for existence
the monosyllabic "Hanks"
has survived to share the distinction
of the original surname.
To have been borne by the
mother of Lincoln is quite
enough to render it illustrious
for all time. A contemporary
said of her that "she was a
woman of superior natural
endowments of mind and of
great amiability and kindness
of heart. She was always gentle,
always kind, but far more energetic
than her husband. She
was quick-witted, with a great
relish for the humorous and a
keen appreciation of fun." Her
husband generously described
her occasional "complaints" as
"chirping"&mdash;a gracious felicity
of speech. Whatever the wit
and charm of the woman, there
was certainly humor, with tenderness
and imagination, in the
man.</p>

in Hardin County, Ky., in

died in October, 1818. She was
buried near the present site of
Lincoln City, and lay for many
years in an unmarked grave.
A "sculptured monument" now
marks the spot. It is a beautiful
shaft of white marble and

<p class="hang">(1) The famous French economist,
Michel Chevalier, traveled
in the United States in 1835.
He says in one of his <i>Lettres</i>
that he remarked at the table
of the hotel a man of about 60
years of age who had the lively
air and alert carriage of a youth.
He was impressed by the
amenity of his manners and by
a certain air of command which
peered even through his "linsey"
habit. This, he learned,
was the distinguished American
general, Harrison, victor in the
Battle of the Thames, one of the
two very celebrated battles of
the war, the other being the
Battle of Tippecanoe. If a
"Norman" battle was ever
fought upon this continent, it
was the Battle of the Thames.
It might have recalled to the
Conqueror his own baptism of
fire. On the eve of battle the
American commander changed
his plans. Having learned that
Colonel James Johnson's cavalry
had been drilled to <i>charge
in the woods</i>, he ordered a
charge to be made by the
mounted Kentuckians upon the
British line, which was drawn
up in a wooded strip of ground
between the river and the
swamp. Their artillery was
planted in the wagon road
which bisected the center of the
British line. The column of
Kentuckians flanking the artillery
was launched upon the
right of the Saxon line with irresistible
force. Reserving their
fire and reversing the movement,
they charged the broken
and disordered line from the
rear, pouring upon it a destructive
fire. The victory was complete.
Colonel R. M. Johnson
charged the Indians in their covert
on the left; and it was here, in
a close hand-to-hand struggle,
that Tecumseh fell, bequeathing
a lifelong controversy to his
foes. It was ultimately settled,
however, in the popular mind
by the traditional couplet&mdash;</p>

addressed as "Dear Cousin."
The letter was in relation to
certain lands in Mason County
then owned by a daughter,
Priscilla Lee; and was of peculiar
interest as confirming the
familiar tradition of a connection
by blood between the two
families of Lee. The name

that American industrialism
has not in the least diminished

the legend of Lincoln, of one of
those men who by their example
alone model after their mind the
conscience of an entire country.

his individuality, humorous and
pathetic at the same time; that

with disgust, yet luminous with
hope, worn out with trials and
still so strong; that statesman

<p class="hang"><i>Peters</i> and <i>Peter</i> (Pierre). Doctor
Thomas Lounsbury, who combines
erudition most agreeably
with common sense, says in a
recent paper that at particular
periods there is manifested a
feeling of "hostility" to certain
words. We have an illustration
of this in the history of the
proper name <i>Peter</i>, which, as
one of the philologists tells us,
"at one time was odious to
English ears." For example, we
find in the statistical nomenclature
of Wiltshire only sixteen
Peters to ninety-two Johns,
and the ratio elsewhere in
other shires or districts is about
the same. Yet we find many
traces of Peter or Pierre (the
original French form) in other
names, as Pears, Peers, Pars,
etc. Peter has been a prolific
propagator of patronymics
in spite of its temporary eclipse;
Peterson, Pearson, Peterman,
Pierson, etc. It does not seem
to have recovered its early popularity,
or to be able to stand
alone; but with desinences attached
it takes and retains its
old position, as in Perkins,
Peterkin, Perrins, Perrutts, etc.
It is a buoyant, resilient Norman
vocable with the characteristic
Norman facility of
assimilation. This one surname

face, impressive and imperious;
the pale and ardent eyes; the
look which shines like the
gleam of a sword. The man
is of a finer mould, but his

and firmer; it is iron transformed

<p class="hang">Many years before the establishment
in Kentucky of a
club or society with a roving
commission for historic research,
there dwelt in the northern highlands
of the Bluegrass region
a sagacious and successful cattle-breeder,
who was a practical
student of pedigrees and had
put the knowledge thus
acquired to a profitable use.
<i>All</i> of his theories would not
have been accepted by Weismann;
nor, on the other hand,
would all of Weismann's theories
been accepted by <i>him</i>.
The conclusions which lay nearest
his special vocation had
been carefully "applied" after
his own fashion, and he was
satisfied with the results. Francis
Galton, himself, had no
better grounds for belief in the
laws of heredity.</p>

<p class="hang">He was a Kentuckian of the
early type&mdash;not unlike the Kentuckians
and Virginians that the
English traveler, Mr. Pym
Fordham, describes in a series
of letters from the South and
West. His mental gifts and
pleasing manners, to say nothing
of his commanding stature,
not only made him conspicuous,
but wherever he went assured
him welcome and the right of
way. There was a look of
quiet resourcefulness in the
man. His facial contour was
striking. The features, seen in
profile, were large, strong, and
regular, and their impressiveness
was notably enhanced by a
broad, flowing beard with the
same reddish tinge that brightened
his locks of long brown
hair. His eye was steady, soft,
and penetrating&mdash;noting everything,
overlooking nothing.
His complexion was peculiar&mdash;not
"ruddy" or glowing from
daily exposure, at all seasons,
in the open air, but of an almost
bloodless hue; as colorless, at
least, and as clear as if untouched
by sun, or wind, or rain, in
his active routine of life upon a
Bluegrass ranch. It was the
life of a man whose time was
largely given to observation
and thought; and as one might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
suppose, he had an ample field
for the indulgence of his studious
tastes. His special line of
work was the propagation of
"high-grade" cattle by crossing
our native stock with fine
imported strains.</p>

<p class="hang">In our pastoral mid-century
days the casual traveler passing
along a mountain road in
the Red River region of Eastern
Kentucky could not have failed
to observe, in the great forests
that cast their dense shadows
as far as the headwaters of
Buckhorn, large herds of native
cattle that browsed and
"drowsed" in the shade of
those deep Druidic woods. If
the traveler were a man of
the English race, and as well
informed and observant as a
traveler should be, he would
say at once, "These cattle are
in no degree akin to the English
blood-stock which I have
seen in the Bluegrass lowlands
of the State. They are wholly
unlike; their 'lines' are wholly
different,&mdash;size, shape, coloring,
deer-like delicacy of structure
and peculiar curve of horn;
nothing in their construction
is heavy or cumbrous except
the deep, rich golden udders of
the kine. They remind one of
no familiar English stock.
They are not Durhams nor
Herefords, nor Devons. Are they
not <i>Alderneys</i>?" At all events,
this was the native stock from
which our practical Bluegrass
theorist obtained his "high-grade"
cattle, by crossing it
judiciously with fine imported
strains from the Channel Isles.
The results were all that could
be desired. The half-grade cattle
were scarcely distinguishable
from the imported stock,
and if the milk was not so
"rich," the quantity was much
larger. The same was true of
the <i>uncrossed</i> mountain stock
which was brought to Kentucky
by the "comelings" of the
Eighteenth Century, and was
never a "degenerate" stock
in any practical sense. The
"deer-like" structure of the
mountain cow came partly from
environment and partly from
race. It was one of the rough-hewn
maxims of mountain husbandry&mdash;"The
best milker is a
cow with a little foot,"&mdash;a
foot that can thread the brushiest
"cove" or climb the airiest
height to crop the nutrient
herbage that makes the nutritious
milk. The succulent
"pea-vine" made the milk;
the tissue-forming "mast" or
acorn made the meat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
little-footed heifer had the freedom
of the range; and, by
some subtle morphologic law,
the locomotive organ that was
small, firm, and well-shaped
seemed to imply or determine
the full symmetric development
of <i>thorax</i> and <i>brain</i> and an easy,
unobstructed operation of the
functions associated with both.
The loyal mountaineer of the
old stamp was chauvinistic to
the core. Though fifty years
have passed, he still grows eloquent
when he recalls the
"fighting bulls" and the flowing
pails of his boyhood days.
A handsome, vivacious Highlander
of this class&mdash;a gentleman
of marked Gallic aspect and
scion of an early pioneer stock&mdash;recently
boasted to the writer,
and almost in the language of
the Vergilian swain (<i>bis venit
ud mulctram</i>), that old "White-face"
came regularly to the
pail twice a day&mdash;yielding six
gallons in two milkings. These
mountain kine were not large;
but they were gentle, spirited,
clean-limbed, fine-haired, and
carried in their generous udders
an abundance of wholesome
milk. They bore indelible marks
of race. Had they been larger,
they might have remained to
this day an untraveled stock.
Their size favored easy transportation,
and the canny emigrant
made note of the fact.
As a consequence of this demand
from emigrants, no doubt, great
numbers of cattle were shipped
from the Channel Islands to
England in the early decades
of the Nineteenth Century&mdash;a
circumstance which completely
answers the assumption that
our mountain cattle were
derived originally from an English
stock. For many years
the name "Alderney" was
applied without discrimination
to all cattle imported from the
<i>Anglo-Norman islands</i> of the
English Channel&mdash;islands which
England has held with an iron
grip since the Conqueror brought
them under English rule. The
thrifty islanders&mdash;descendants
of the old Norman stock and
for years clinging tenaciously to
the old Norman dialect&mdash;are
now true Anglo-Normans, making
daily proclamation of their
loyalty to the English crown,
and, until a very recent period,
always in Anglo-Norman
French.</p>

<p class="hang">Only this then remains to be
said. A thoughtful Bluegrass
cattle-breeder, bearing a distinctively
Anglo-Norman name
that had come down from Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>mandy&mdash;through
England and
Virginia to Kentucky<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;and
bearing in his own person characteristics
and distinctive marks
of his Anglo-Norman descent&mdash;utterly
indifferent to "ethnological"
theories and absolutely
unconscious of his own descent
from the Anglo-Norman race,
is convinced&mdash;not by "herd-books"
or historic pedigrees&mdash;but
simply and solely by the
evidence of his own eyes, that
a certain native stock of cattle
in the mountains of Kentucky
were merely an <i>earlier importation
than his own</i> from the
Anglo-Norman islands of the
English Channel. He had the
courage to put his theory to the
touch of practical experimentation,
and the astonished
"experts" at the great cattle-fairs
of the country bore generous
testimony to the quality
of his work.</p>

<p class="hang">If such conclusions are fairly
deducible from an imperfect or
incomplete study of a race of
CATTLE in the mountain region
of Kentucky, why should a logical
mind discredit like conclusions
resting upon testimony

Vernon Mills, which produced

south as the West Indies, and
popular wherever known. The
proprietor had an Anglo-Norman
eye for trade, and nothing,
it is said, interested him more
than "the prices of flour and the
operations of his mill." He
naturally became the leader of
a "commercial aristocracy" in
Virginia. Miss Mary Johnson,

<p>"In living form,"&mdash;says Mr.
Green, "are now to be heard in
the Southwest, words and pronunciations
which have remained
unaltered at least since
the time of Simon de Montfort."
"The Virginian"&mdash;says the same
writer&mdash;"has a good opinion of
himself; is calm, well-balanced;
is self-reliant, and has the English
quality of not being afraid
to take responsibility." In
other words, his blood is Scandinavian
or Norman, cooled by
the icy currents of Wessex.
A correspondent of the <i>Spectator</i>
(London) writes: "It is
often asked what has become
of old English families. I have
just gathered white water-lilies
from the fields of 'De Vere,'
now known as <i>Diver</i>; one of
my neighbors is 'Bohun' abbreviated
into <i>Bone</i>; 'Roy,' a
grand sample of the English
laborer, was recently carried
into the old church-yard; for
many years I employed the
tall and stately 'Plantagenet,'
known on my labor books as
<i>Plant</i>; a shop in the neighboring
town is kept by 'Thurcytel,'
the modern spelling being <i>Thirkettle</i>;
'Godwin,' the last of
his race, died at a grand old
age a year ago; 'Mortimer'
buys my barley; and around
me we have such names as
Balding, Harrold, Rolf, Hacon,
and Mallett."</p>

"The Beautiful Scandinavian" of the French traveler was Mrs. Elizabeth Wall,
wife of that popular gentleman, Judge Garrett S. Wall. Her maiden name was
<span class="smcap">Buckner</span>&mdash;Elizabeth Buckner&mdash;a native of Kentucky and daughter of a famous
Southern house. That she was a very beautiful woman, her portrait (taken years
after marriage) amply attests; and until her ill-health came, her beauty retained,
in almost ideal perfection, its characteristic grace and charm. The Beautiful
Scandinavian, from whose portrait in oil a halftone likeness is presented in
this book, now takes her place in history and moves down its interminable lines
with an escort that recalls the "bands of gallant gentlemen" attendant upon
<span class="smcap">Fair Inez</span> when she "went into the West."</p></div>

place in February, 1876. His arrival was handsomely noticed in the local papers&mdash;in
the <cite>Eagle</cite>, edited by Mr. Thomas Marshall Green, the author of "The Spanish
Conspiracy"; the <cite>Ledger</cite>, edited by Mr. Thomas A. Davis, who still presides over
its columns with all the old-time ability; and the <cite>Bulletin</cite>, edited by Mr. Clarence
L. Stanton, a son of Judge R. H. Stanton, and a gallant officer in the Confederate
Navy during the Civil War. All these gentlemen were present at the lecture, and
the distinguished traveler was introduced to the audience by Colonel Thomas M.
Green. The lecture was followed by an entertainment at the Limestone Club,
which was pleasantly noticed by Captain Stanton in his paper of the following
day. The Committee of Reception and Entertainment was composed of Major
Thomas H. Mannen, Judge Garrett S. Wall, Colonel Francis P. Owens, and
Doctor Thomas E. Pickett (the President of the Club).</p></div>

by his Virginian mother, she says: "I hear you have become a notorious
rattle and never open your mouth without an oath." To correct this vicious tendency
she recommends the example of the "great and good General Washington."
Excellent advice. The General's oaths were not so frequent as Bolling's.
They were louder, deeper, "heartier."

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> When Otto, the <i>Saxon</i>, a remote kinsman of our race, became a Roman
Emperor, he became the <span class="smcap">Conservator</span> of Rome and all her works. When
William the Norman became King of England and the leader of Gothic
races, it was his chosen mission to undo, in part, the work which Rome had
done. As a soldier and statesman, the Norman leader had been trained in the
"school" of the Saxon King. Read Mr. Freeman's "Western Europe in the
Eighth Century." It is an impressive introduction to that "realm of shadows"
which forms the background of the Norman Conquest. It was the genetic
period of modern civilization. The geographic outlines of great modern States
were just beginning to appear.</p></div>

with the blood. The Kentuckian, however, has learned to "rest his horses"
before he has learned to read.</p></div>
